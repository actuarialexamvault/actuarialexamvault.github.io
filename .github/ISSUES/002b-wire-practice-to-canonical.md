title: Wire Practice page to canonical `exam_links.json` (F102 mapping)

body: |
  Summary
  -------
  Connect the Practice-by-Chapter page to the canonical `resources/pdfs/exam_links.json` so it can show available PDFs for chapters. This issue focuses on F102 only and uses the attached CSV mapping `resources/chapter-question-mapping/F102_question_papers_melted.csv`.

  Goals
  -----
  - Convert the provided CSV mapping into a JSON mapping file `resources/practice/chapter_map_F102.json`.
  - Load `resources/pdfs/exam_links.json` at runtime (reuse `js/pdf-links.js`).
  - Expose a frontend helper (e.g. `js/practice-links.js`) that loads the chapter map and
    provides `ready` plus `getMappedPapersForChapter(chapter)`.
  - Render chapters on `pages/practice.html?subject=F102` with mapped past-paper entries and
    show availability badges determined via `js/pdf-links.js`.

  Acceptance criteria
  -------------------
  - `pages/practice.html` displays chapters for F102 with a list of mapped past-paper entries and PDF availability badges.
  - `resources/practice/chapter_map_F102.json` is added and checked in (generated by the transform tool).
  - The frontend uses `hasPDFLink()` from `js/pdf-links.js` to mark available/missing PDFs.
  - Missing PDFs are shown as "No PDF" with a link to the official past papers page.

  Implementation steps
  --------------------
  1. Add a transform script `tools/convert_F102_csv_to_chapter_map.py` that reads
     `resources/chapter-question-mapping/F102_question_papers_melted.csv` and writes
     `resources/practice/chapter_map_F102.json` with the shape:

       {
         "Unit Pricing": [
           { "session": "Jun", "year": 2010, "paper": "1", "question": "Q1" },
           ...
         ],
         "Asset Share": [ ... ]
       }

  2. Add `resources/practice/chapter_map_F102.json` (generated by the script) to the repo.
  3. Add `js/practice-links.js` which fetches the chapter map and exposes `ready` and
     `getMappedPapersForChapter(chapter)`.
  4. Add `js/practice-script.js` (or expand existing `pages/practice.html` script) to render
     chapters and mapped items for `?subject=F102`, showing availability badges using
     `hasPDFLink(subject, session, year, paper)`.
  5. Add `resources/practice/README.md` documenting how to regenerate the JSON map from the CSV.
  6. Add unit tests under `tools/tests/` for the CSV→JSON transform (happy path + malformed rows).

  Testing & QA
  ------------
  - The CSV→JSON script includes a smoke test that verifies every mapped entry has keys
    `session` (string), `year` (number), `paper` (string), and `question` (string).
  - Manual QA: open `pages/practice.html?subject=F102` and confirm chapters render,
    available papers have a clickable PDF link and badges, and missing PDFs show "No PDF".

  Rollout notes
  -------------
  - This is phase 1 (F102 only). For subsequent subjects, generate `chapter_map_<SUBJ>.json`
    using the same CSV→JSON transform pattern and add to `resources/practice/`.

  PR checklist
  ------------
  - [ ] Add `tools/convert_F102_csv_to_chapter_map.py`.
  - [ ] Add `resources/practice/chapter_map_F102.json` (generated).
  - [ ] Add `js/practice-links.js` and `js/practice-script.js` updates.
  - [ ] Add `resources/practice/README.md`.
  - [ ] Add tests under `tools/tests/` covering the transform script.

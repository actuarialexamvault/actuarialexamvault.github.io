                        <p class="answer">After completing a practice exam, click "Upload Submission" and select your answer file (PDF, Word, or image format). Your file is stored locally on your device for privacy. It will not be shared with anyone including the developer.</p>

                        <p class="answer">No, the timer cannot be paused once you've started an exam. However, you can cancel your current attempt and restart at a later time. This design helps replicate authentic exam conditions for better practice.</p>

                        <h4 class="question">How does AI-assisted grading work?</h4>
                        <p class="answer">Our platform provides a carefully engineered grading prompt that you can use with any AI chatbot (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.). Simply copy the prompt, paste it into your chosen AI tool along with the question, examiner's report, and your answer, then input the AI's score into our system.</p>

                    <div class="qna-item">
                        <h4 class="question">How was the AI grading prompt designed?</h4>
                        <p class="answer">Our AI grading prompt was engineered to replicate how real actuarial examiners mark papers. It emphasizes strict adherence to marking standards, proper point allocation (0.5 marks per valid point), assessment of key competencies (idea identification, information use, conciseness, idea generation), and focuses on demonstrating professional actuarial competence rather than lenient marking.</p>

                        <h4 class="question">Can I customize the AI grading prompt?</h4>
                        <p class="answer">Yes, you can adjust the prompt to your preferences. However, ensure you maintain consistency across all your grading sessions. If you modify the prompt, use the same version for all questions to ensure fair comparison of your performance over time.</p>

                        <h4 class="question">What are the limitations of AI grading?</h4>
                        <p class="answer">AI can sometimes hallucinate or make errors. Its marking quality can degrade over longer conversations. Always review the AI's feedback critically and compare it against the official examiner's report. If something seems off, trust the examiner's report or seek clarification from study groups or tutors.</p>

                    <div class="qna-item">
                        <h4 class="question">Should I grade multiple questions in one AI chat session?</h4>
                        <p class="answer">No, we strongly recommend grading only one question per AI chat session. Start a fresh conversation for each question to maintain consistent marking quality and avoid context degradation that can occur in longer chat windows.</p>

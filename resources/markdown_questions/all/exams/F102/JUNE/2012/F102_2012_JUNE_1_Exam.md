[Total 8]
QUESTION 2
A mutual life office has large, established portfolios of with-profit and unit-linked endowment assurances. Surplus is distributed to the with-profits policies by means of terminal bonuses and annual compound reversionary bonuses, which are smoothed.
It has been suggested by an actuarial student that smoothing be reduced and that reversionary bonuses more closely reflect investment returns.
Discuss the implications of the suggested change in surplus distribution policy for the company and policyholders.
[8]

QUESTION 3
LifeCo writes its conventional whole of life policies targeted at low-income consumers through insurance brokers. There is limited underwriting on these policies and insurance brokers are remunerated solely through initial commission on the sale of the policy. The distribution manager has suggested that LifeCo introduces a new commission scale where higher levels of commission are paid to brokers that have been identified as "key brokers".
i. List four criteria LifeCo might use to define "key brokers".
[2]

ii. Outline briefly the advantages to the insurer of adopting the "key broker" approach.
[2]

QUESTION 4
SouthernRock is a large insurer specialising in credit life assurance on home loans. Due to the economic climate, many policyholders are extending the term of their mortgages, and consequently the term on their credit life assurances.

i. List the checks you would carry out on the policy data for the purpose of reporting on the
alterations to policy terms.
[3]

ii. Describe how you would investigate the recent trends in the alteration experience.
[4]

Your findings suggest a material increase in policy term to maturity. Consequently, you have decided to alter your investment strategy.
iii. Describe how asset-liability modelling can be used to test the probability of insolvency for a
specific investment strategy.
[4]

iv. State what implications the lengthening in policy term is likely to have on the insurer's
investment strategy.
[3]

QUESTION 6
You are the product development actuary working for a life insurance company which focuses on the low income market in a developing country. You are designing a 10-year term assurance product that, in addition to a death benefit, pays policyholders a fixed lump sum for each day (beyond the third) they are hospitalised. Level monthly premiums are payable for the duration of the contract. Premiums are based on age at entry (to a maximum age of 60) and vary in 10-year age bands (i.e. 21-30, 31-40, etc.).
Initial underwriting is limited to two simple underwriting questions which aim to establish whether the policyholder is reasonably healthy at the time of applying for the contract and is not intending to seek medical advice in the three months following the application.
i. Describe the cross-subsidies that exist in this product design.
[4]

ii. Outline how the existence of cross-subsidies impacts on the factors that need to be considered
in designing the product.
[8]

[Total 12]
QUESTION 7
A life insurance company wishes to introduce a guaranteed insurability option on its term assurance product. All policyholders will pay a premium for the option and on expiry of the original policy term, they can take out a new policy on the then standard premium rates without evidence of health.
i. Discuss briefly the advantages and disadvantages of this proposal to the company.
[2]

ii. Suggest ways the company could manage the risks associated with the option.
[6]

iii. Explain the key assumptions necessary to price the option, and outline how the pricing
actuary should go about setting these assumptions.

QUESTION 8
A recently-established life insurance company intends to issue regular premium unit-linked individual income protection (long-term sickness) contracts. Several of the country's largest life offices have been involved in this market for some years.
Units will be cancelled regularly to meet the risk premiums and expense charges. The office will retain the right to vary the risk and expense charges to reflect experience, and office premiums are to be reviewed on a 5-yearly basis.
The risk benefit is a fixed amount to be determined at outset, but the policy also provides a premium waiver during a claim, with unit allocations and cancellations continuing. On death, surrender or at the end of the policy term the policyholder will receive the bid value of the units (although this is not expected to be a significant amount).
i. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed product design to the policyholder
compared with a traditional non-linked income protection (long-term sickness) product.
[6]

ii. List the major features on which income protection (long-term sickness) contracts are sold.
[2]

iii. Outline the risks faced by the life office in respect of expenses
[3]

iv. Suggest types of risk reinsurance which the office may wish to put in place, outlining the
reasons for each.

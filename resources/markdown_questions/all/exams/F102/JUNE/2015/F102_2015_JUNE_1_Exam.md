QUESTION 2

QUESTION 4
An established life insurance company has traditionally sold a wide range of protection and savings products to the upper- and middle-income market. The company plans to introduce a regular premium 15-year unitised with-profits savings product to be sold to lower-income government employees, marketed as a product to save for a child's tertiary education. The proposed features of the product are as follows:

- Maturity benefit: Accumulated premiums plus regular and terminal bonuses (bonuses may not be negative).

- Surrender benefit: Accumulated premiums plus regular bonuses less a surrender penalty and a market value reduction, if applicable.

- Partial withdrawal benefit: A maximum of two partial withdrawals after the first five years of the policy, of not more than 20% of the accumulated premiums plus regular bonuses.

- Death benefit: None, on the death of the policyholder the policy could be surrendered or be converted to paid-up unless there is a waiver of premium benefit as outlined below.

- Charges: Premium allocation rate, fixed per premium policy fee and an annual fund management charge.

- Optional benefit (for an additional premium): Waiver of future premium on death or permanent disability of the policyholder, with minimal underwriting required.

i. Outline the advantages of this savings product for targeted customers.

QUESTION 5
A popular product in a particular country is a regular premium, unit-linked savings product with a term of 10 years. The only permissible product charge is a level fund management charge. On surrender, a surrender penalty is deducted from the value of units. The maximum commission payable on the sale of such products, as prescribed in the insurance regulations, is a single upfront amount equal to twice the annual premium.
The regulatory authority is considering revising the insurance regulations for these savings products as follows:

- Disallowing any surrender penalties.

- Setting the maximum commission payable to:

- an upfront amount equal to the annual premium; plus

- a recurring amount of 10% of each regular premium (paid to the advisor on receipt of the premium in each year after the first). The product design actuary has recommended the following changes to the design of the product to accommodate the changes in regulations:

- increasing the fund management charge from the current level of 2% p.a. to 4% p.a.; and

- refunding 50% of the charges deducted over the term of the contract on maturity (applicable only to the maturity benefit). Discuss the suitability of the proposed changes to product design (including those required by the revised regulations), in terms of the relevant product design factors.

[10]

QUESTION 6
A life insurer selling regular premium without-profits endowment assurances has recently performed an experience investigation. The results of this investigation indicate that the insurer has had more surrenders at early durations than expected, and as a result it is making losses on surrenders. The insurer is considering making changes to its surrender value basis to minimise the negative impact of these early surrenders.
i. Describe a general approach to setting surrender values and suggest, with reasons, the
approach this insurer might adopt.
[10]

ii. Explain how the assumptions for interest, expenses, inflation and mortality will be determined
for the purpose of setting a prospective surrender value basis.

QUESTION 7
You are a newly qualified actuary and have just been appointed as the actuary responsible for product development, pricing and reinsurance at a small mutual insurer in a developed country where HIV is not a concern to insurers. The insurer's Board of Directors has identified the need to aggressively grow the number of members to ensure the sustainability of the mutual. The mutual has decided that the best way to achieve this is to use the direct-to-consumer approach through the internet, selling a regular premium without-profit term assurance product.
i. Describe briefly the various ways in which a reinsurer could assist the mutual with this plan.
[4]

ii. Outline how you would structure the underwriting for this product.
[4]

QUESTION 1
A life insurance company has historically sold conventional with-profits (CWP) policies, but has now decided to stop selling CWP contracts and to launch unitised with-profits (UWP) contracts for new business, in a separate fund.
Outline the advantages and disadvantages of this decision for the insurer as well as for the CWP and UWP policyholders.
[8]

QUESTION 2
An insurer is planning to add a new benefit to its product range, namely a critical illness benefit. This benefit, like others from this insurer, will be unit-linked. The benefit is offered on the following terms:

- Guaranteed lump sum benefit on occurrence of one of the critical illnesses as defined in the policy document

- The benefit payable on death or maturity is the value of the unit fund (if positive)

- The surrender value is equal to the bid value of units less a surrender penalty (if positive)

- Units can be purchased in a wide range of investment funds

- Risk charges and management charges are deducted monthly from the unit fund to cover the cost of the critical illness benefit and expenses, respectively

- Premiums are calculated such that the unit fund is projected to be equal to the sum insured at the maturity date, under prudent assumptions

i. Outline the benefits that are provided, and the policyholder needs that are met, by such a
product.
[3]

ii. Outline the investment-related risks to the insurer of this product and how such risks can be
mitigated.
[5]

After consulting with brokers, the company now plans to offer a minimum guaranteed unit fund on death or maturity based on an investment return (before taxes and charges) equal to 3% p.a., in an environment where CPI is expected to be around 3% p.a.
iii. Outline both how this benefit change increases the risks to the insurer, and ways to mitigate
these risks.

QUESTION 3
A company has a large book of without-profit critical illness business, which is 100% reinsured on a risk premium basis.
i. List the risk factors which can be used to classify the critical illness data into homogeneous
groups for a claims experience investigation.
[3]

Each year the company's actuarial team spends a significant amount of time investigating the claims experience on all of the company's products, including the above-mentioned critical illness product. A manager in the company has made the following comment regarding this book of critical illness business. "Since this business is fully reinsured, the company is not exposed to any morbidity risk on it.
This book should thus be excluded from future investigations into claims experience, as the claim investigation results for this product do not add value to the company. This change will also save the actuarial team a significant amount of time."
ii. Discuss the manager's statement, noting areas where these investigations might add value.
[9]

QUESTION 4
You are a product design actuary working for a large insurance company with a significant existing book of immediate annuity business. Historically, only age and gender have been used as rating factors when determining the single premium for annuities in this market.
The regulatory authority in this country has expressed concern that the current market practice leads to poor value for money for the low income market. The regulator suggested that socio-economic class should be introduced as an additional rating factor. A small specialist annuity writer recently launched such a product and you now want to launch a competing product.
i. Explain briefly why the current market practice may lead to poor value for money for the low
income market.
[1]

ii. Discuss briefly the factors that you will consider when designing your company's annuity
product.

QUESTION 5
A life insurance company allows its without-profits endowment assurance policyholders to extend the terms of their policies on request. The new premium payable after such an alteration is calculated by equating present values before and after the alteration, on the current premium basis (which may differ from the policy's original premium basis).
Outline the factors that the company would have considered in assessing the suitability of this method for calculating the altered premium.
[10]

QUESTION 6
The insurance supervisor in a well-developed life insurance market has introduced a new regime for valuing policyholder liabilities and calculating the solvency margin for life insurers. Policyholder liabilities are calculated using a market-consistent approach using best estimate assumptions and the minimum solvency margin is determined using a value-at-risk measure that will ensure that the assets will be sufficient to cover the liabilities at a 99.5% level of confidence over a one-year time horizon.
i. Describe the market-consistent method for determining the provisions for the policyholder
liabilities for life insurers.
[7]

ii. Explain why the insurance supervisor requires life insurers to maintain a minimum solvency
margin and explain the relationship between the strength of the provisions for policyholder liabilities and minimum solvency margin requirements.
[2]

The new solvency regime requires insurers to apply a set of stress tests to their assets and liabilities.
These stress tests are selected to reflect extreme cases of risk events for life insurers. A medium-sized insurer offering a range of life products in this market has calculated the additional solvency margin required under each of four individual stress tests. These amounts are as follows: Mortality stress test: $3 million Longevity stress test: $2 million Market stress test: $4.5 million Default of reinsurers: $0.5 million
iii. Explain why the aggregated amount of additional solvency margin for these risks should be
less than $10 million for this insurer, including in the explanation a description of how the aggregated solvency margin could be calculated.

QUESTION 7
You are the senior pricing actuary at a large life insurance company in a well-established market.
Your company has written group income protection policies for the last 20 years. It is now considering entering the individual life (without-profits) income protection market. All sales will be made through intermediaries, who are either tied agents or independent brokers. The State does not offer any income protection benefits to individuals.
i. Outline briefly how the underwriting of the individual life product will differ from that of the
group product.
[2]

ii. List the factors defining the benefit, and the assumptions that you would require, to price the
new individual life income protection product.
[7]

iii. Outline how you would go about setting the claim inception and termination rates for pricing
the individual life income protection product, explaining to what extent the data from the company's group product may be relevant.
[6]

QUESTION 8
The insurance industry in your country has agreed to new requirements for products that are designed for low-income consumers. You are the actuary to a small life insurance company which currently sells to this market.
The requirements, agreed by the industry, include that no medical examinations may be requested when underwriting and HIV/AIDS exclusions may not be used. Rates may only differ by age.
i. Discuss the risks arising from the industry agreement and from offering products to this
market, and explain how product design factors (excluding reinsurance and underwriting) could help to reduce this risk.
[10]

Your company's main source of new business is from the parent company which is a bank.
ii. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of selling to the low-income market through the
bank versus selling via direct marketing.

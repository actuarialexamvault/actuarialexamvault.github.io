QUESTION 1
You are the senior pricing actuary at a large sub-Saharan life insurance company. One of the company's main risk products is a without-profits whole of life insurance with no surrender value, sold through independent intermediaries. The company has sold this product for several decades. Due to the company's relatively strict underwriting the premium rates are very competitive.
The company is planning to launch a direct offering of the whole of life insurance within the next 12 months. You expect the average sum insured to be less than half of that on the existing product. The company intends to do all of the underwriting on-line and through a call centre. The product will be marketed through mass media advertising (television, radio, newspaper, internet) as well as through mobile phone SMS campaigns.
i. List 8 key parameters that you would require assumptions for in order to price the new
product.
[2]

ii. Outline how you would set the assumptions for the parameters listed in (i), with specific
emphasis on the three most important parameters.
[12]

QUESTION 2
i. Describe briefly the two methods which could be used for allocating bonuses to the unit fund
for a unitised with-profits (UWP) contract.
[1]

ii. Explain the key differences between UWP and unit-linked contracts.
[3]

A UWP single premium product with a term of 15 years allocates bonuses to policyholders' unit funds through a mixture of regular and terminal bonuses. The product provides:

- A death benefit of the value of the unit fund subject to a minimum of a return of the premium.

- A maturity benefit of the accumulated fund value including any regular and terminal bonuses.

- A surrender benefit equal to the accumulated fund value less a pre-determined surrender penalty. No Market Value Adjustment is applied to a surrender. The following charges are levied on the policy: a bid-offer spread, annual management charge and a charge for risk benefits.

iii. Describe how a cashflow model could be used to determine the value of the expected future
profit from the in-force UWP business.

QUESTION 3
Insurer A, a large life insurer in a country with a well-developed investment market is considering taking over a portfolio of in-force without-profit immediate annuities from Insurer B. The liabilities relating to this portfolio of annuity business will be transferred to Insurer A together with a transfer of assets from Insurer B.
Describe how Insurer A could determine the value of the transfer of assets required, using a marketconsistent approach, in exchange for the transfer of the annuity portfolio liabilities.
[8]

QUESTION 4
i. Outline briefly the principles that a life insurance company should follow when setting
surrender values.
[4]

It is proposed that the surrender values for a new conventional without-profit whole life product be determined using a blended approach based on:

- Retrospective values (based on the asset share) at early durations; and

- Prospective values using assumptions (based on the current premium basis) at later durations. The surrender values will not be guaranteed and projected surrender values are not included in disclosures to policyholders.

ii. Explain how such a blended approach would meet the principles outlined in (i).
[5]

iii. Outline ways in which the approach to setting surrender values could be changed in order to
increase the profit made on surrenders.
[2]

QUESTION 5
i. Explain how regulations might affect the investments of a life insurance company.
[4]

A small, but rapidly growing, life insurer which sells mostly with-profits endowment assurances whereby profits are distributed by the additions to benefits approach, is currently facing a low level of free assets. The proportion of its liabilities backed by fixed-interest investments is significantly higher than the industry average.
ii. Explain why the insurer might have such a high level of fixed-interest investments.

QUESTION 6
You are the product development actuary of a small life insurance company that currently only sells term assurance products. The company is in the process of redesigning this product and is considering adding an option to new policies under which policyholders may increase the level of cover during the term of the policy and/or renew the policy at the end of its original term without providing additional evidence of health.
i. Define the cost of a mortality option and outline the factors affecting the cost of a mortality
option to the life insurance company.
[6]

ii. Discuss the impact this redesign would have on the company's underwriting process.

option.
[6]

QUESTION 7
A large well-capitalised insurer with a wide product range has recently launched an annuallyrenewable funeral insurance product covering the policyholder and his/her immediate family members. The product targets low income customers and will be sold through funeral parlours on a voluntary basis. The product has been initially priced assuming the same probability of claim for all individuals covered by adjusting the mortality assumption for a similar product sold to the lowermiddle income market. The business model relies on salaried agents of the insurer for the marketing and ongoing servicing of the product to funeral parlours.
i. Outline the mortality, persistency and expense risks that the insurer faces relating to this
product.
[7]

The insurer has been losing money on this product for the last four years.
ii. Outline briefly various investigations which the insurer could perform in order to understand
the factors causing the losses.
[5]

The investigations performed by the insurer have indicated that higher than expected mortality and lower than expected retentions have caused the losses.
iii. Suggest four actions, for each of these two problem areas, which could be taken by the insurer
to address the poor experience.

QUESTION 8
i. Define long term care insurance.
[2]

A life insurance company in a developed country currently sells mainly regular premium unit-linked whole life assurance contracts. Mortality improvements in the country have been greater than expected by the insurance industry over the past decade The insurer is considering introducing an optional long term care rider to its regular premium unitlinked whole life assurances. It is proposed that the combined new product will have the following features.

- The surrender value will be the bid value of the units less a surrender penalty.

- The death benefit will be the bid value of the units.

- The long term care benefit will be an annuity purchased at the prevailing annuity rates in the market (at the time of a claim) using the full bid value of the units. The annuity will be subject to a guaranteed minimum monthly amount, which will be selected at the time of purchasing the rider.

- If a policyholder claims the long term care benefit the unit fund will reduce to zero and will start building up again (through the continuing payment of premiums) until subsequent surrender or death.

- The long term care rider will only be available to individuals aged below 50 effecting new policies.

ii. Discuss the key factors to be considered by the insurer when assessing the suitability of the
proposed product design.

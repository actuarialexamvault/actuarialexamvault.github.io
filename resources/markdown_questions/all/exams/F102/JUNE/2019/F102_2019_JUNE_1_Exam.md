QUESTION 1
A relatively new life insurer in the local market sells conventional term and whole of life assurances through a combination of call centres and independent brokers.
i. Outline why it is important for the insurer to monitor aspects of new business sales.

i. Outline how the chief pricing actuary would go about setting the mortality assumptions.
[7]

[5]

iii. Outline the effects that this ruling may have on the mortality experience of Forsure over the

QUESTION 7
A man is considering taking out an 18-year, regular premium, endowment assurance to provide for his new-born daughter's tertiary education. He would like to receive at least R1 million in maturity benefits.
He is considering investing in a with-profit product with an initial sum assured of R500 000 payable in the event of death or maturity.
Companies A, B and C operate in the local life insurance market, and all offer conventional with-profit endowment assurance policies.

- Company A distributes surplus by means of regular, simple reversionary bonuses.

- Company B distributes surplus by means of regular, compound reversionary bonuses as well as by terminal bonuses which vary by term and duration.

- Company C distributes surplus by methods other than increasing the benefits.

i. Discuss why Company B's endowment assurance policy may be expected to have a higher
maturity value than Company A's.
[4]

ii. Suggest how Company C is likely to be distributing surplus, and explain briefly why this is
unlikely to be an appropriate option for the man.
[2]

iii. Outline other considerations that the man should take into account when deciding between a
policy from Company A and one from Company B.
[4]

Assume that the man survives to the end of the term of the endowment assurance policy, and that Company B declares a terminal bonus at maturity of 25% of attaching bonus only.
iv. Calculate the average annual bonus rates that Companies A and B would have to declare for
the man to receive his targeted maturity benefit.

QUESTION 8
The insurance regulator in a developing country has commissioned the industry association to develop standardised features for two single premium retirement income products:

- Conventional level annuity, guaranteed for the life-time of the policyholder.

- Unit-linked "income drawdown" product, where the single premium (less initial fees) is invested in one of a range of investment funds, as selected by the policyholder. The policyholder selects a percentage, subject to a specified maximum, of the fund value to be received every month. This percentage may be changed at each policy anniversary. Management charges will be deducted from the fund on a monthly basis.

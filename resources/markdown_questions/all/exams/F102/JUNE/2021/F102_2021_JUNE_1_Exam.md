QUESTION 1
i. Explain how the relationship between:

- the earned asset share;

- the prospective reserve using the original pricing basis; and

- the prospective reserve using a realistic basis, will give an indication of the profit extracted on the surrender of a without-profit contract.

[4]

A life insurance company is designing a new regular premium unit-linked savings product which provides no risk benefits. The only charge on the product is a management charge of 1% per annum.
An actuarial student proposed a design for a penalty to apply when a policyholder requests a reduction in the term of the policy. The proposed penalty to be deducted from the unit fund is: 0.5% × n × (the fund value at the time of alteration) where n is the reduction in the outstanding term of the policy measured in years. For example, if the original term is reduced by 1.5 years, then the penalty is equal to 0.75% of the fund value at the time of alteration.
ii. Discuss briefly the suitability of the proposed alteration penalty.

QUESTION 4
i. Describe how a passive valuation approach differs from an active approach.
[2]

A life insurance company that sells conventional with-profit endowment assurances, on a singlepremium and recurring-premium basis, has been using a passive valuation approach and the net premium valuation method for calculating its reserves for both statutory and internal management purposes.
One of the directors remarks that "The net premium valuation method makes no allowance for future bonuses and is imprudent because it does not include future renewal expenses. Furthermore, the company's passive valuation approach uses outdated assumptions and values that distort the company's true financial position."
ii. Discuss the points that you would make in addressing the director's comments.
[6]

The board of directors has decided that an active valuation approach is to be used for future internal management purposes.

QUESTION 6
People's Life writes a large volume of credit life polices where the policyholders are clients of a large micro-finance institution, People's MFI that is part of the same financial services group. It is compulsory for the borrowers of People's MFI to purchase the credit life policy from People's Life when they take out a loan from People's MFI. The credit life policies pay the outstanding balance of the loan on the death of the policyholder.
People's MFI only issues low value (average loan value R15 000) and short-term (average term 9 months) loans. People's MFI is remunerated by People's Life through commission and service fees for new business administration, on-going policy servicing and administration of claims.
People's Life has decided to expand its product range by offering a 1-year term assurance policy with a sum assured of R15 000 to the low-income market sold through an in-bound call centre staffed by salaried agents. The product will not be underwritten and there will be no differentiation in premiums by age or sex.

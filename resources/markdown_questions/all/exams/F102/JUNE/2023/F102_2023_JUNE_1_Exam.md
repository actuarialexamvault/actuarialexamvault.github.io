ii. Suggest, with reasons, a suitable portfolio of assets to match the following policies written by
the insurer: a. Without-profits whole life assurance; and b. Without-profits immediate annuities.
[3]

iii. Outline how you would determine the cost of the investment guarantee using stochastic
modelling techniques.
[3]

[Total 8]
QUESTION 2
An insurance company sells a without-profit 20-year term assurance product. The maximum sum insured is large and hence underwriting is required.
i. Outline the options available to the underwriter to deal with risks identified in the underwriting
process as being non-standard.
[4]

ii. Describe the process of "claims underwriting" and explain briefly how claims underwriting
plays a role in managing risk for the insurance company.

i. Describe the inception / disabled life annuity approach to costing income protection benefits.
[3]

ii. Describe the multi-state modelling approach to costing income protection benefits, indicating

[Total 14]
QUESTION 4
A life insurance company that sells without-profits term assurance contracts only is considering how to calculate the adjusted premium to charge policyholders who request a change in their smoking status classification. These are policyholders who were classified as smokers when they bought the policy but have now stopped smoking for an extended period of time. In terms of the company's new business underwriting practices, these lives would now be classified as non-smokers. The sums assured on their policies are to remain unchanged.
The company proposes calculating the new premium for an altered policy by equating prospective policy values. The original pricing basis will be used to calculate the policy value before alteration and the current pricing basis applicable to new business policies sold to non-smokers will be used to calculate the policy value after alteration.
Discuss the considerations that you would take into account in evaluating this proposal.

QUESTION 5
i. Define "appropriation" and "expropriation" prices for unit-linked business.

A small insurer selling regular-premium unit-linked pure endowments in a developing country is experiencing strong growth.
ii. Explain whether the company is more likely to be using the "offer" basis or the "bid" basis for
calculating the unit price for its unit-linked pure endowment.
[2]

Key reasons for strong new business growth include generous upfront commission paid to brokers, an attractive minimum guaranteed maturity value of a return of premiums paid, and strong investment returns earned on US technology shares which make up the largest portion of the unit fund.
The company is reviewing the assumptions for the product for the statutory valuation.
iii. List 8 assumptions that are likely to be needed for the valuation.
[2]

The capital requirements are calculated using a risk-based VaR approach, based on a specific confidence level over a one-year period.

capital requirements for this endowment product.
[8]

[Total 14]
QUESTION 6
An established life insurance company sells conventional with-profits endowment assurance policies where policyholders share only in the investment and mortality surplus with bonuses distributed using the "additions to benefits" method. It has been the life insurance company's practice, and is its strategy, to distribute a significant proportion of the surplus in the form of terminal bonuses.
i. Discuss the key factors influencing the appropriate asset mix for these with-profits policies and
suggest appropriate assets.
[5]

The insurer is considering closing the book of with-profits endowment policies to new business.
ii. Discuss the factors that the company should consider when deciding upon the split between

QUESTION 7
Continent Life writes an annually renewable term assurance product with very low sums assured in an African country. The product only covers the policyholder's life and policyholders must be aged between 18 and 70. Low- and middle-income earners are targeted with this product.

The product is sold solely through Continent Life's direct marketing team, and the insurance application is done entirely via the policyholder's mobile phone using a dedicated phone application ("app"). The company has not asked for policyholder information other than the name and date of birth at new business stage and has historically charged a single undifferentiated premium rate per unit of sum assured to all policyholders.
The product has been making mortality losses for several years and it has been proposed that age-rating is implemented for this product.
i. Discuss the main factors to consider in evaluating this proposal.
[8]

Assume that the proposal was adopted and that it is now three years after implementing the age-rating change. Continent Life is conducting a withdrawal experience analysis based on the last five years of data.
ii. List 4 factors by which data could be grouped for this analysis.
[2]

The results of the analysis show that lapse and withdrawal rates for this book as a whole, for the preceding year, were significantly higher than expected.
iii. Suggest some further analysis the company could carry out and outline briefly actions the
company may take to address the poor withdrawal experience identified.

QUESTION 8
Critical illness (CI) insurance in a particular country may only be offered through conventional products providing lump sum benefits. Almost all companies in the country provide cover for the 10 major CIs identified by the National Industry Body (NIB). From time to time the NIB will revise the list of illnesses included in the list of major CIs.
TopCI has written CI insurance in this country for many years. To distinguish itself from the other players in the CI market it intends to launch a new CI product as outlined below, to be sold through independent intermediaries:

## Page 6

- Initially policyholders will select only 5 of the 10 major CIs to include in their cover.

- Initial underwriting will be carried out in the same way as would have been done had all 10 CIs been covered.

- On stated dates, and without any further evidence of health having to be provided, policyholders will have the option to increase the number of CIs covered under their policy - up to the maximum number then recognized by the NIB.

- The initial premium rate for this policy will be significantly less than the premiums charged for the other CI products available in the market (as those generally cover all 10 of the major CIs).

- The premium rates to be charged in respect of any additional CIs added to the cover are not guaranteed.

i. Outline the additional morbidity risk TopCI would face if it offers the proposed CI product as
well as its current (standard) CI product.
[4]

ii. Outline briefly 6 reasons why the proposed product may produce disappointing levels of new
business take-up.
[3]

iii. Suggest 8 ways (other than reinsurance) in which TopCI could reduce the morbidity risk if it
decides to offer the proposed product (without changing the core product features outlined above), explaining how each suggestion will help reduce the risk.

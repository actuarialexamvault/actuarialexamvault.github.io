QUESTION 8
In a developing country life insurance has largely been sold to middle- and high-income individuals.

Over the past few years some insurers have expanded to targeting low-income individuals with conventional without-profits funeral cover term assurance, on which the only benefit is a lump sum payment sufficient to cover the funeral costs of the insured.
BigLife, a well-established insurer in this country is considering entering the low-income market. It plans to sell conventional without-profits whole life insurance products, providing funeral cover which will also provide a moderate lump sum death benefit to be paid to the insured's dependants.

Underwriting, which will be in line with that carried out by competitors, will be limited compared to BigLife's current underwriting.

contribute to making BigLife's premiums for this product more expensive than those for the existing funeral cover policies offered by competitors.

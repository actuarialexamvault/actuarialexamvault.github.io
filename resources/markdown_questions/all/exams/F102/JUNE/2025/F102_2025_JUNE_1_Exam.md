QUESTION 1
A life insurance company is designing a new conventional without-profits whole life product. Premiums will be payable monthly in advance. The proposed surrender value for this product is:

- 50% of premiums paid to date of surrender if surrender takes place during the first 2 years, and

- a prospective policy value on best estimate assumptions for any surrender thereafter.

i. Describe how the basis is likely to be determined for the calculation of the policy value.
[6]

ii. Explain how each of the following events, considered independently, is likely to affect the asset
share, the surrender value and hence the retained profit on a policy that surrenders: a. A sharp decrease in long-term interest rates; and b. The onset of a new incurable disease leading to an increase in mortality.
[7]

[Total 13]
QUESTION 2
A life insurance company launched a simplified-underwriting term assurance product three years ago.
The simplified-underwriting product allows policyholders to obtain life insurance cover up to a specified sum assured by only answering a few health- and lifestyle-related questions without requiring the usual physical examinations or the collection of body-fluid samples.

i. Outline the advantages of such a simplified-underwriting product for applicants.
[2]

ii. Outline the risks to the insurer of offering the simplified-underwriting product.
[3]

After carrying out an experience investigation, the company has identified that the actual mortality experience is higher than that anticipated in its pricing basis.
iii. Discuss possible reasons for this and why the company may be concerned about it.
[5]

iv. Outline the actions that the company could take to improve its mortality experience.

QUESTION 3
i. Define the cost of a mortality option.
[1]

A life insurance company offers a continuation option to members leaving a group life scheme which it underwrites and which offers death benefits equal to three times employees' annual salary. The option allows exiting members to effect an individual without-profits whole life assurance with the same sum assured at standard (non-smoker) rates before their retirement age, contingent on their passing a test confirming that they are not smokers.
ii. Discuss the key factors the company should consider when pricing this mortality option.
[6]

iii. Explain 2 ways in which anti-selection could manifest under the option.
[1]

iv. Suggest, with reasons, strategies to mitigate the anti-selection risk.
[4]

[Total 12]
QUESTION 4
A life insurance company recently started offering conventional without-profits deferred annuities with a 10-year deferred period where the policyholder pays monthly premiums in arrears during the deferred period and receives a guaranteed monthly annuity thereafter until death.
Policyholders who are deemed to be in suitably poor health at the end of the deferred period, subject to confirmation by underwriting, will be granted an enhanced annuity. The amount by which this annuity will exceed their guaranteed standard annuity will depend on their state of health as assessed at the end of the deferred period. Enhancement terms will be guaranteed and specified on sale of the deferred annuity.
i. Outline the needs that the product meets for policyholders and for the company.
[5]

ii. Identify and outline the key risks faced by the company from offering the enhanced annuity as
well as how each of these risks can be managed.

QUESTION 6
i. Outline the key features of the contribution method for distributing with-profits bonuses.
[3]

A life insurer sells with-profits whole life assurances with bonuses calculated and distributed using the contribution method.

Mortality rate 0.010 p.a. 0.005 p.a.
Expenses at the start of the year 100 p.a. 200 p.a.
ii. Calculate the dividend applicable at the end of the year for the contract outlined above.

QUESTION 7
A life insurance company has two books of annuities that are open to new business. The first book offers policyholders level annuities. The second book offers policyholders inflation-linked annuities.
i. Outline the characteristics of these liabilities, and hence suggest suitable assets for matching
them

An analysis of surplus has revealed that in each of the last two years the level annuity book has been loss making. The insurer uses a best-estimate valuation basis for this analysis.
ii. Discuss possible reasons for losses on the level annuity book, including elements of experience
that could be contributing to these losses.
[6]

[Total 11]
QUESTION 8
A recently established life insurance company intends to issue regular premium unit-linked individual income protection contracts, with the following structure:

- The risk benefit will be a fixed regular amount per policy determined at outset.

- There will be a premium waiver during a claim, with unit allocations and cancellations continuing.

- On death, surrender or at the end of the policy term, the policyholder will receive the bid value of the units (although this is not expected to be a significant amount).

- Units will be held in the company's conservative investment fund.

- Units will be cancelled regularly to meet the risk premiums. The office will retain the right to vary these charges to reflect experience.

- Office premiums will be reviewed on a 5-yearly basis.

i. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed product design to the policyholder
compared with a conventional income protection product.

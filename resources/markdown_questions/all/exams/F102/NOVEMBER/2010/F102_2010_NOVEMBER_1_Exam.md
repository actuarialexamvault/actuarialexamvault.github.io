Question 3 A small mutual life insurance company sells without-profits unit linked endowments and conventional with-profits policies. Reversionary and terminal bonuses are declared on the with-profits products using the addition to benefits method. The country in which the company operates is recovering from a harsh recession and unitlinked new business sales have started to increase. The with-profits policies, however, are becoming unpopular in the country and sales on these products have been poor with the result that the size of this book of business is diminishing. In an effort to stimulate the economy the government has reduced the repo rate and the economy has shifted into a low interest environment. The company has reduced its reversionary bonus rates.

QUESTION 1
The dominant life insurer in a small developing country sells mainly group life business to clothing manufacturers and construction companies. The standard group life cover provides a benefit of twice annual salary on death. Mortality assumptions used in determining the premiums for the group life cover are reviewed annually taking into account the experience of each insured scheme. The insurer is considering expanding the number of rating factors that it uses for group life premium rates.
i. Outline the likely automatic-acceptance criteria for the group life cover.
[2]

ii. List the sources of medical information that could be used to underwrite individuals with high
sums insured.
[2]

iii. Describe the process the pricing actuary would follow for reviewing the group life mortality
assumptions.
[4]

A mortality analysis reveals poor experience in the insurer's schemes for construction companies. The insurer is considering increasing the premium rates for these schemes. This would result in the rates being higher than those charged by its competitors.
iv. Outline briefly the risks to the insurer of increasing premium rates for construction companies
above those of its competitors.

QUESTION 3
You are the actuary of a specialist captive insurer (GHI) that was established by High Finance Bank (HFB) to provide instalment protection policies to individuals taking out home mortgages with HFB.
Borrowers are compelled to purchase instalment protection policies from GHI with the bank as beneficiary in order to cover mortgage repayments during periods of incapacity. Mortgages are repaid by monthly instalments of capital and interest, and are variable rate, i.e. repayments vary with interest rates. GHI's instalment protection policies are without-profits policies with guaranteed premium rates.
The instalment protection benefit at inception is equal to the initial level of the mortgage repayment.
The benefit level is revised annually to be in line with the then current mortgage repayment. The premium is also adjusted annually to reflect the revised benefit level. Incapacity is based on occupational definitions and there is no deferred period.
Your finance director notes that there has been a reduction in the return on capital of the product as a result of higher claims experience, and he suggests that the business should be reviewed. He suggests reviewing the rating factors and that a three-month deferred period be introduced, in line with common industry practice.
i. List, with explanations, the demographic factors that could impact on the claim inception
and/or termination rates.
[5]

ii. Outline briefly the purposes of a deferred period for instalment protection policies.
[2]

iii. Discuss the merits of the director's suggestion to introduce a deferred period.
[3]

iv. Suggest other changes that GHI could consider to improve the return on capital of the
product, outlining briefly the potential risk to GHI of each proposal.

QUESTION 4
The Chief Actuary of People's Life Insurer has commissioned a review of the surrender terms of its individual regular premium without-profits endowment assurance policies. This product is sold to government employees and cover is terminated if the policyholder moves to the private sector.
Surrender values are calculated using asset shares at early durations and a prospective policy value thereafter. The use of asset shares results in low surrender values at early durations, compared to premiums paid.
i. Describe, without the use of formulae or diagrams, the prospective value methodology and
how suitable assumptions might be determined for surrender values.
[7]

ii. Outline the risks to the insurer of continuing to use the current methodology for determining
surrender values.
[3]

[Total 10]
QUESTION 5
A life insurer has a large book of 15-year annual premium unit-linked endowment assurance policies.
Commission to sales agents is 50% of each of the first two premium payments. Furthermore, 95% of each premium is allocated to the unit fund and there is a fixed annual management charge of 5% on this unit fund.
The benefits under the policy are structured as follows: Death: maximum of the bid value of the units or 100% of premiums paid Maturity: maximum of the bid value of the units or 110% of the premiums paid Surrender: bid value of the units less a surrender penalty (the surrender penalty starts at 15% of the value of the unit fund and reduces over the term of the policy) A change in the regulatory environment has led to higher levels of required capital for insurers and pressures on this insurer's solvency position.
i. Describe two methods that can be used to determine the cost of the investment guarantees to
the insurer.
[5]

ii. Outline the weaknesses of the current charging structure.
[8]

iii. Describe how actuarial funding may be used to address some of these weaknesses.

introduction of the new regulations.

QUESTION 7
A newly established insurance regulator in a developing country has been given the mandate to develop regulations for assessing the financial soundness of life insurers. These regulations will include setting requirements for valuing the assets and liabilities and determining the minimum solvency capital of life insurers. The government has set the following policy objectives for the insurance regulatory framework: "The objectives of the insurance regulatory framework are to grow a healthy life insurance industry and to protect policyholders."

requirements for assessing the financial soundness of insurers.
[10]

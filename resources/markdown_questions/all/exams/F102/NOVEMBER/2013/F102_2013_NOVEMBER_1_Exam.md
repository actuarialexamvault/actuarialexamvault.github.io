QUESTION 1
A newly qualified actuary is conducting an analysis of surplus exercise for a book of endowment assurances which has been closed to new business for a number of years. The actuary notices that the actual per policy expenses are much higher at the current valuation date than at the previous valuation date.

[8]

QUESTION 2
A large charitable trust manages a number of retirement communities across a particular country. Two types of living arrangements are provided at each of these communities:

- Independent Accommodation; and

- Frail Care: Full-time nursing and personal care in specialised accommodation at the retirement community. It is common for retired persons to move into Independent Accommodation initially and then move to Frail Care, the much more expensive option, if and when their level of incapacity necessitates fulltime care. The charitable trust has approached several large insurers to design a long-term care product to be sold to members of the retirement communities. The two product structures being considered are as follows:

- Option A: A pre-determined monthly cash benefit payable from when the policyholder first enters Frail Care. The benefit increases by 6% per annum and is payable for the remainder of the life-time of the policyholder.

- Option B: A cost of care benefit paying the additional costs of the Frail Care arrangement (over and above the cost of the Independent Accommodation) until the death of the policyholder. The maximum monthly frail care benefit at any time is capped at 2.5 times the initial additional monthly cost of Frail Care at claims inception.

i. Suggest claims definitions for this product and outline briefly the key considerations when
determining such claims definitions.
[3]

ii. Outline the relative advantages and disadvantages for the policyholder of each benefit option.
[3]

iii. Describe the general business environment factors that should be considered by a life
company writing this business.

QUESTION 3
A life insurance company writes only conventional protection business. You have recently been made responsible for reinsurance arrangements at the company.

The managing director has asked you to undertake a review of the company's reinsurance arrangements.
i. Suggest reasons why, when it was originally negotiated, it may have been beneficial to the
insurer to set up the current reinsurance arrangement.
[2]

ii. Highlight key disadvantages of the current reinsurance arrangement.

QUESTION 4
A small life insurance company in an emerging market country sells a regular premium unit-linked pure endowment investment product through independent brokers and bank agents. The product currently only offers two investment portfolios:

The product development actuary has noted that a few asset managers are offering clients the opportunity to invest in properties such as hotels and shopping centres. He has thus created an additional portfolio offering for the unit-linked recurring investment product that allows individuals to invest in such property via the insurance company, with the underlying policyholder funds being invested directly in properties.
ii. Outline the main considerations regarding financing requirements, risks and profitability
when adding the new property portfolio to the investment offering for the unit-linked product.

QUESTION 5
You are the pricing actuary for a large, well-established South African life insurance company. For many years the insurer has focused on whole life assurances, immediate annuities and unit-linked investment products for the middle and higher income markets.
The existing whole life product has a minimum sum assured of R200 000 and no maximum sum assured limit. The average sum insured for the business sold is R800 000. Extensive underwriting is applied for this product. Each applicant is required to complete a detailed application form, which contains medical questions. Applications are flagged for additional medical tests based on the answers to the medical questions and the size of the sum assured. The underwriting information is used to determine whether lives are accepted at standard rates, loaded, declined, or specific exclusions are applied. Pricing for this product makes use of rating factors common in the market.
The company is launching a regular premium simple whole life assurance product with limited underwriting and with no surrender value. The minimum sum insured will be R50 000 and the maximum R300 000. This product will be sold via the same distribution channel as the existing product.
i. Suggest, with reasons, an appropriate approach to the underwriting of the new simple whole
life product.
[3]

ii. Identify the assumptions needed to price the new product, and describe how you would set
each assumption.

QUESTION 7
A life insurance company is designing a new 10-year regular premium unit-linked savings product.

i. Explain how a stochastic model could be used to model the cost of the maturity guarantee.
[5]

An actuarial student has proposed that the following penalties (to be deducted from the unit fund) should be applied if the policy is altered by the policyholder: Alteration Penalty Premium reduction (10% of the chosen percentage reduction in premium) × bid value of units (For example, if premiums are reduced by 40% then the surrender penalty will be 4% of the bid value of the units) Alteration or partial 10% × bid value of units being disinvested disinvestment

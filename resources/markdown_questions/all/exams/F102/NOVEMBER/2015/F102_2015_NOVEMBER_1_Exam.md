QUESTION 3
i. List the main features of single premium unit-linked investment products.
[5]

ii. a. Explain the basic equity principle that applies to the pricing of an internal unit-linked
fund. b. Define the appropriation price of a unit fund and describe how the basic equity principle is applied when determining the appropriation price for a fund.
[3]

Summit Life sells a single premium retirement income product designed to be purchased by individuals at retirement. The premium less commission and initial fees is used to purchase units in an investment fund at policy inception. Annuity payments and management charges are deducted from the fund on a monthly basis. The annuity payments are expressed as an agreed percentage, determined at the outset, of the fund value at the time of payment of the annuity. After 10 years the bid value of the units in the fund is converted to a level monthly annuity, at the insurer's annuity rates at that time.
The bid value of units is also payable as a lump sum on death or surrender within the first 10 years of the policy.
The insurer is considering adding a guarantee to new policies. The guarantee would provide a minimum annuity payment for the level annuity equal to the average monthly amount paid from the fund in the three years prior to conversion to a level annuity. Policyholders selecting this guarantee will be restricted to investment in a single unit-fund. The guarantee will be charged for by adding a guarantee fee into the initial fees charged at the inception of the policy.
iii. Outline the benefits to the policyholder of the addition of this guarantee and the risks that
remain with the policyholder, in relation to both the unit-linked savings income and the level annuity component of the product.
[5]

iv. Describe how a cashflow model could be used to estimate the cost of the guarantee.
[7]

[4]

ii. Outline the risks to the company of the surrender values being too high or too low.

QUESTION 5
Community Bank is a large bank providing banking services to the low-income market. The bank has recently established a subsidiary licensed to write life insurance business. Initially, the only product to be sold by this subsidiary is a low sum assured whole life insurance product with monthly premiums.
Policies are sold through sales agents in the country-wide network of bank branches. Sales agents are remunerated through initial commission on the basis of nine months of premiums on the sale of a policy, without clawback on lapses. There are no surrender benefits and premiums are guaranteed for the duration of the contract. The insurer has added the following differentiating product features:

- Loyalty benefit: Policyholders receive a cash benefit of one year's premium if their premiums are up to date at the fifth policy anniversary.

- Premium skip: Policyholders may miss two premium payments, but the policy will lapse if the missed and current premiums are not paid at the next premium payment date. The supervisory authority requires annual valuations of the policyholder liabilities using a gross premium valuation approach.

i. Describe the gross premium valuation method for determining the policyholder liabilities for
this product.
[4]

ii. List the checks on the data and outputs of the valuation of the policyholder liabilities that
would generally be performed to validate the results.
[5]

The product is initially priced using lapse assumptions for products with standard features in the market. After six years a lapse experience investigation is conducted, which shows that actual lapses have been much lower than the assumption used in the valuation of policyholder liabilities. It is expected that lapse rates will continue at this lower level for the foreseeable future and the insurer decides to reduce its best estimate assumption for lapse rates for the calculation of the policyholder liabilities.
iii. Explain the expected effect on the value placed on policyholder liabilities as a result of this
change in the valuation assumptions.
[3]

The better-than-expected lapse experience has motivated the insurer to take further actions to try to reduce its lapse experience.
iv. Outline actions that the insurer could take to reduce its lapse risk and improve lapse
experience.

QUESTION 6
i. a. Define the term 'embedded value'. b. List the assumptions that are required to calculate an Embedded Value for a withoutprofits life assurance business.
[4]

You are the Statutory Actuary for a large, well-established life insurance company. The company's executive remuneration scheme is currently based on its after-tax profits for the year, which are compared against the company's after-tax profits for the previous year. It has been concluded that the executive remuneration scheme should balance overall performance with performance in the areas which the particular executive can influence. You have proposed that this might be achieved by the use of Embedded Value profit methodology.
ii. Discuss, using examples, how this might be done and comment briefly on whether it might
result in the interests of management and shareholders being better aligned.
[5]

iii. List other reasons for performing an analysis of Embedded Value profit.

QUESTION 7
An established life insurance company in a particular market writes mainly UK-style with-profits business.
i. Outline the factors that the insurer should consider when selecting assets to back the liabilities
for its with-profits business.
[8]

The investment guidelines currently allow asset allocations of 70%-80% in equities, 15%-25% in fixed interest investments and 0%-5% in cash. The company is now proposing to change its investment policy to have up to a maximum of 60% in equities/property and the rest in fixed interest investments and cash.
ii. Discuss the possible impact of the change in investment guidelines on the company's bonus
distribution strategy and the factors the company should consider before implementing a change.
[6]

A new life insurance company to the market is planning to introduce a with-profits product range, but intends to move away from UK-bonus style of reversionary and terminal bonuses. This company is considering distributing surplus to policyholders only via regular cash dividends on the contribution method.
iii. Outline briefly the advantages and disadvantages for the policyholder and the company of
distributing bonuses in this form, as opposed to the use of a reversionary and terminal bonus structure.

QUESTION 3
You work for a start-up insurance company which plans to start selling business in a few months' time. Your first product will be a regular premium 10-year unit-linked endowment assurance with a maximum guaranteed sum insured of R1 million.

The only charge on the product will be an annual management charge, which will be the same fixed percentage for all policyholders.

by the insurance company; current products are sold on a fully guaranteed basis.

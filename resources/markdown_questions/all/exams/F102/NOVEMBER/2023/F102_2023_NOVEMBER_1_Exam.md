minimum maturity and surrender values.
[3]

[Total 9]
QUESTION 2
An actuarial student proposes using the "equating policy values" method when policyholders request altering their conventional without-profits whole life assurance policy to a conventional without-profits term assurance policy with the same sum assured. The policy value before the alteration would be set equal to 90% of the policy's asset share as at the date of alteration. The policy value after alteration would be calculated using the current pricing basis for new products.
Discuss the considerations that you would take into account in evaluating this proposal.
[13]

change.

iii. Discuss the expected impact of the following scenarios on the insurer's liabilities, capital
requirements and free capital on 31/12/2023. a. An unexpected large increase in claim administration expenses during 2023. b.

QUESTION 6
A medium-sized life insurance company in a developing market offers a wide range of unit-linked life insurance products. Recent changes in regulations allow life insurers to invest overseas, which had previously not been allowed. The office is planning to expand its range of products by launching a new (regular premium) unit-linked endowment assurance product with the following characteristics:

- Policy benefits:

- The death benefit will be the bid value of units.

- Surrender values will be equal to the bid value of units less a surrender penalty. However, on each 5th policy anniversary there will be a guaranteed minimum surrender value equal to a return of 75% of premiums paid.

- There will be a guaranteed minimum maturity value equal to a return of premiums.

- The unit fund to be offered will invest only in overseas equities.

- The only charge to be levied will be an annual management charge. The charge will be fixed at 6% p.a. for units issued in the first year and 1% p.a. on units issued thereafter.

i. Outline briefly the customer needs met by this product.
[2]

QUESTION 7
i. List the 4 main types of underwriting.
[2]

A large life insurance company has a well-established book of risk business that is sold mainly through independent intermediaries. The company writes a significant number of policies on lives considered as non-standard risks with appropriate loadings to the premium rates. The loadings are also applied to the modelled mortality rate in the valuation.
ii. Outline the reasons that the company would accept non-standard risks.
[2]

iii. Outline the ways the company could monitor and manage the mortality risk associated with
such non-standard risks, other than through alternative underwriting decisions such as imposing exclusions.
[4]

The company recently performed a valuation of these policies. Upon investigation, an error was identified whereby the loadings for premiums and mortality were not applied and the standard rates for both were used in the valuation. The actual premiums being paid by sub-standard lives are correct.
iv. Outline how this error would have impacted the valuation results.
[3]

QUESTION 8
The government in a developing country has recently implemented new legislation relating to unitlinked retirement products. From the implementation date of the legislation:

- All future contributions to both new and existing unit-linked retirement products will be split into two parts:

- One third of all contributions will go towards a unit-linked "accessible fund" (AF). The policyholder will be able to access these funds at any time prior to the specified retirement age but will be restricted to at most one withdrawal per calendar year. At retirement, the accumulated value in the AF may be taken as a lump sum or used to purchase an annuity.

- Two thirds of all contributions will go to a unit-linked "retirement fund" (RF). The policyholder will not be able to access these funds prior to the specified retirement age. At retirement, the accumulated value in the RF must be used to purchase an annuity.

- Accumulated funds in existing unit-linked retirement products will, on implementation date, be transferred to the policyholder's RF.

- On death prior to retirement both the AF and RF are paid to the nominated beneficiaries.

Prior to this change, all contributions to unit-linked retirement policies had to be held by the insurer until retirement, at which time the unit funds had to be applied to purchase an annuity. Prior to retirement the only payments which were permitted were on death (equal to the full value of the fund) or after three months of unemployment (a once-off lump sum up to a specified legislated percentage of the fund).
i. Outline reasons why the government might have introduced this new legislation.
[5]

ii. Discuss how this legislation might affect an existing insurer in this market.
[6]

An insurer in this market is considering offering policyholders guaranteed annuity options. This will allow policyholders the option to lock-in annuity rates prior to purchasing their annuity at retirement if they annuitise with the insurer.
iii. Outline the advantages and disadvantages to the company of introducing this guaranteed option.

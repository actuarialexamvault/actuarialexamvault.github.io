QUESTION 8
A recently established life insurance company is building its portfolio of conventional without-profits term assurance policies designed to appeal to younger, tech-savvy customers. The basis of its offering is that after initial acceptance, policyholders may adjust their sums assured and premiums, without underwriting at specified life events such as marriage, purchasing a car or a home or the birth of a child.
Interaction with the company is through a mobile phone application (app) where, in addition to doing policy administration, the policyholders are encouraged to disclose personal information that may trigger benefit increase events. The company uses this information to offer benefit increases which are easily accepted and verified with minimal paperwork. Premiums are adjusted as required and policyholders are notified of their new premiums or benefits via the app.

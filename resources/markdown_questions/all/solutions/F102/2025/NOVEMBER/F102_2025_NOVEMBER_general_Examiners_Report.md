QUESTION 1
i. Risks to the policyholder:

- The main risk borne by the policyholder is that the amount of benefit provided is lower than expected, on surrender, death and on maturity. ➢ This is caused by reversionary and/or terminal bonuses being lower than expected.

- Although these with-profits contracts should provide some protection against inflation, this might not be the case in the event of poor investment returns and poor resulting bonuses.

- The policyholder is exposed to the risks that final bonuses are lower than expected due for example to: ➢ investment returns being lower than expected ➢ expenses being higher than expected ➢ other surpluses being lower than expected (e.g. higher than expected guaranteed mortality payments)

- The policyholder carries some risk of the insurer becoming insolvent.

- The policyholder is exposed to the risk of being unable to maintain premiums due to accident, sickness, redundancy, or other loss of income. ➢ The benefit received if the policy is surrendered or made paid-up may not appear to be good value for money.

- There is the risk that the policyholder does not understand the policy; and therefore it may not meet their needs. ➢ For example, if the policy was taken out to repay a mortgage on a house and the risks not explained.

- There is a risk that changes in taxation may reduce the value from the policy.

ii. Calculation of asset share

- The asset share is the accumulation of premiums less deductions associated with the contract ➢ This is accumulated at the actual rate of return earned on investments.

- An allocation of profits on any without profits business written in the with-profits fund will also be allocated to the asset share.

- Deductions include all expenditure associated with the contract, in particular: ➢ Commission paid; ➢ expenses incurred (direct or indirect); ➢ the cost of providing any minimum guaranteed life cover possibly on a smoothed, rather than current cost basis; ➢ the cost of providing any options, e.g. option to increase minimum guaranteed life cover; ➢ the cost of providing the maturity guarantee; ➢ allowances for tax. ➢ transfers of profit to shareholders; ➢ the costs of any capital necessary to support contracts in the early years; F102 N2025 © Actuarial Society of South Africa

## Page 3

➢ a contribution to the free assets, to support the smoothing of bonuses and the ability to exercise greater investment flexibility.

- The asset share can be calculated recursively on a year-to-year basis.

- The asset share can be calculated for an individual policy or a group of policies.

iii. How the asset share could be used to set an amount for:

- Both maturity and death benefits may be subject to a guaranteed minimum (e.g. initial sum assured plus vested bonuses subject to a minimum). ➢ Thus asset share has no impact if the guaranteed minimum bites. ➢ This is most likely for death early in the policy term.

- The maturity value will be based on average asset share over time.

- It will depend heavily on the smoothing policy and so a particular maturity value may be above or below its asset share.

- The bonus rates are likely to be based on the asset share for an average policy, rather than each individual policy.

- If death occurs close to the maturity date, the insurer may wish for the death benefit to reflect the asset share more closely for consistency reasons Examiner's Comments Part (i) and Part (ii) were generally well answered. It was evident that some candidates did not know the theory, in which case they scored substantially worse than others. Some candidates wrote lost marks writing about accumulating with-profits and others wasted time writing about various bonus distribution methods. Part (iii) was generally not answered well and it reflected weak understanding of how an asset share is used. Candidates did not focus on the average asset share for a cohort of policies or in the case of minimum guaranteed benefits, that the asset share would have no impact on the death or maturity benefits. Many candidates thought that the maturity value must always be the same as the asset share, some suggested it must always be less otherwise the insurer makes a loss, and others thought it must always exceed the asset share.

QUESTION 2
i. Increased risks:
Expense risk

- The replacement of upfront charges with an increased fund-based charge delays expense recovery, especially for acquisition costs. ➢ This creates a cashflow mismatch and may result in significant new business strain.

- If policyholders lapse at early durations, the insurer may be unable to recover acquisition costs, especially as these are now recovered through charges that accrue over time. F102 N2025 © Actuarial Society of South Africa

## Page 4

- The pricing and profitability of the new structure depends on assumptions about withdrawals, mortality, investment returns, and premium sizes. ➢ If any of these are mis-estimated, the insurer could face losses.

- The new charging structure is more dependent on fund value, as there are more ongoing charges linked to fund value than initial charges. ➢ Lower than expected investment performance would reduce the fee income, even if expenses remain fixed, leading to the risk of insufficient charges to cover expenses. Investment risk

- More policyholders than expected may opt to invest in the more aggressive fund choices. ➢ This would result in more volatility in fund values and hence in charges than expected.

- There may be some reputational damage if an aggressive fund performs very poorly

- the insurer may be seen as partly to blame due to it making that fund choice available to policyholders. Mortality risk

- The introduction of the guaranteed minimum death benefit increases the insurer's liability on death. ➢ This is particularly so at early durations where the unit fund may be lower than the guaranteed amount.

- Since only a basic health declaration is required, this introduces increased antiselection risk, as individuals with known health issues may be more likely to buy cover.

- If this increased anti-selection risk is not adequately allowed for in the mortality assumptions, it may lead to losses for the insurer.

- Mortality claims at early durations may cause a strain since insufficient charges have been collected to recoup upfront expenses.

- Past mortality experience on which assumptions have likely been based may no longer reflect the revised product's risk profile ➢ This would be particularly so if the new features attract different segments of the market. Withdrawal risk

- Introducing partial withdrawals may encourage earlier and more frequent fund outflows, which may result in smaller charges than expected to cover expenses.

- Such withdrawals may also be anti-selective by those in poor health

- Regular withdrawals may reduce the unit fund, increasing the cost of the guaranteed minimum death benefit for the insurer, if death occurs during the guarantee period. New business volumes and competitive risk F102 N2025 © Actuarial Society of South Africa

## Page 5

- The revised structure may be based on optimistic assumptions about new business growth. If actual sales are lower, fixed costs may not be recouped.

- High sales volumes may place a significant strain on administrative processes.

- Competitors may undercut the insurer or offer more attractive terms, reducing the expected take-up and profitability of the revised product. Robo-advice tool risk

- The robo-tool may recommend inappropriate funds, leading to poor outcomes for policyholders and potential complaints ➢ or reputational damage for the insurer.

- Policyholders may misunderstand the nature of the tool and assume it provides regulated advice, leading to liability in the event of losses.

- The algorithm may have biases or flaws not detected in development, leading to misallocation of customers to funds. Outsourcing and operational risk

- Outsourced administration introduces risk of service delays, errors, or poor customer experience. ➢ This could potentially affect the insurer's reputation and persistency experience.

- Problems during the migration of the administration to a third party can lead to errors, delays and data issues.

- There is counterparty risk related to the possibility of the third-party provider failing, which could result in the insurer having to take back the administration function at a high cost.

- Transferring customer data to an external provider increases the risk of breaches or regulatory issues under data privacy laws.

- The administrator may increase their fees over time, and if the company is unable to review their charges then there is a risk of losses the company.

ii. Ways to manage risks:
Expense risk

- The insurer can consider making use of actuarial funding or the use of negative non-unit reserves, if allowed, to recover acquisition costs from future charges and reduce new business strain.

- Introduce reviewable charges to allow the insurer to adjust charges periodically if experience deviates significantly from assumptions.

- Ensure sufficient stress testing and scenario modelling is conducted before launching the revised product to assess profitability and solvency under stressed conditions. Mortality and investment risk F102 N2025 © Actuarial Society of South Africa

## Page 6

- Introduce waiting periods or exclusions, for example, only cover accidental death for the first 6 months to deter anti-selective purchases.

- Obtain reinsurance cover for the guaranteed minimum death benefit, especially in the early years, to help smooth claims volatility and protect capital.

- Monitor emerging experience, particularly for the guaranteed minimum death benefit, to update valuation and pricing assumptions if adverse trends emerge.

- Narrow the fund options or use the robo-tool to steer customers towards the safer fund choices to achieve more predictable investment outcomes.

- Reduce the sum assured threshold above which more detailed underwriting is required, to reduce the risk of anti-selection.

- Introduce a risk charge on the unit fund to cover the cost of the mortality guarantee. Withdrawal risks

- Limit partial withdrawals to once every few years, say 3 years, or delay eligibility of partial withdrawals to reduce the risk of early depletion of the fund value.

- Increase the surrender penalties on full withdrawals or introduce surrender penalties on partial withdrawals to discourage early lapses. Robo-tool risks

- Validate and test the robo-tool thoroughly, including expert oversight, independent reviews and scenario testing to ensure recommendations are suitable.

- Provide clear disclaimers clarifying that the tool is guidance, not regulated advice, to limit legal liability. Third-party risks

- Define clear performance metrics and penalties for the outsourced admin provider to ensure accountability.

- Regularly review the service providers' systems, controls and compliance with data protection laws. Examiner's Comments Most candidates struggled to score well in this question. Candidates were required to think through the practical implications of the product changes and the additional risks that would arise as a result. Candidates who provided generic risks did not score well. Many candidates failed to appreciate that it was a single premium unit-linked policy and therefore the main risks arise from the impact on charges and expenses, rather than on premiums. F102 N2025 © Actuarial Society of South Africa

## Page 7

Candidates who tried to combine parts i and ii of the question into a single solution did not score well.
Candidates needed to consider the additional risks arising from each of the proposed changes, as well as practical methods of managing these risks.
QUESTION 3
i. Main needs met:

- The benefit on maturity allows the policyholder to save for a specific purpose ➢ The range of investment portfolios meet the need for diversification

- The death benefit meets the need of providing for the policyholder's dependents or liabilities due on death (e.g. paying back a loan). ➢ As the policyholder can specify the sum assured, the product can be tailored to be more of a risk product (a relatively large sum assured, for a given premium) or a savings product (a relatively small sum assured, for a given premium). ➢ The death benefit is also a way of passing wealth to the next generation in a tax-efficient way

- The surrender benefit could provide funds in the case of a financial emergency.

- The charging structure is relatively simple and therefore easy to understand.

- The policyholder can specify the premium and therefore meet the need of affordability. ➢ Premiums are also payable monthly, which again makes the product more affordable than a single premium product, for example.

- As the product is unit-linked, the policyholder carries some risk (e.g. investment risk) which means this product is possibly more cost effective relative to a nonlinked version of the contract.

ii. Reasons for a minimum premium:

- Each policy must contribute adequately to the company's expenses and profit. ➢ The minimum premium ensures that the fund management charge will be sufficient, on average over the duration of the policy, to adequately meet these expenses and profit contribution. ➢ There may be some cross-subsidies in this regard, with larger policies contributing relatively more than smaller policies.

- The premium needs to be sufficient to meet the cost of cover. ➢ As the policyholder can select the sum assured, the minimum premium will need to be at least sufficient to meet the cost of cover.

- Attracting a specific target market. ➢ Higher premiums should lead to a higher income/wealth client profile which may be the preferred target market for the insurer.

iii. Method:
F102 N2025 © Actuarial Society of South Africa

## Page 8

- The expropriation price is the price at which a unit would be cancelled and is determined as: ➢ The net asset value of the fund on a "bid basis"; ➢ Divided by the number of units existing at the time of calculation (before any units are cancelled).

- The net asset value of the fund on a "bid basis" is calculated as: ➢ The market value of the assets held by the fund on a bid basis. ➢ Less the expenses that would be incurred in the sale. ➢ Plus the value of any current assets (e.g. cash on deposit). ➢ Less the value of any current liabilities (e.g. investments purchased but not yet settled). ➢ Plus any accrued income (e.g. interest income on deposits) net of any outgo (e.g. fund charges). ➢ Less any allowance for accrued tax, if applicable.

iv. Examples include:

- The unit price includes accruals and the actual cashflows may be different to the accrual. ➢ For example, when an asset is sold, the actual capital gains tax (CGT) may be different to the accrual for CGT due to a change in the CGT rules. If the tax accrual was understated (overstated), then policyholders who previously sold (bought) units, would have benefitted from the actual tax being different to the accrual relative to the current (previous) generation of policyholders.

- The value of some assets, like property, will have to be estimated. ➢ For example, if a property is sold for a price that is lower (higher), than the estimate, then policyholders who previously sold (bought) units, would have benefitted from the actual selling price being different from the previous estimate relative to the current (previous) generation of policyholders. Examiner's Comments Part (i) was mostly bookwork but candidate performance was mixed. Some students did not provide examples of needs. Part (ii) required some insight, and overall candidates did reasonably well. Weaker candidates did not elaborate on the cross subsidy inherent in a proportional charge. Part (iii) was mostly bookwork and overall candidates did reasonably well. Most candidates struggled with part (iv) as many tried to explain the equity principle rather than picking up on when the formula may lead to inconsistencies e.g. estimations involved when estimating tax accruals and interest accruals.

QUESTION 4
i. Policy data checks:

- Data reconciliation checks whereby the current data is checked against the previous data as follows: ➢ Data at previous investigation + business come onto the books - business gone off the books = data at current investigation. ➢ This can be done for appropriate groups of contracts, such as by year of entry. ➢ For example, this check can be done for:

- the number of contracts,

- basic sum assured,

- premiums, or

- amount of attaching bonuses.

- Consistency checks whereby metrics per appropriate group are sensible and consistent with previous, for example: ➢ Averages of asset shares, sums assured, reversionary bonuses and premiums ➢ Ratios of asset shares and sums assured to premiums ➢ Ratios of reversionary bonuses to sums assured.

- Consistency of data between different sources, for example: ➢ The movements data (business coming on and going off during the period) can be checked against appropriate accounting data (specifically premiums and benefit payments). ➢ Investment data from fund managers (e.g. investment income and assets) can be checked against accounting data. ➢ Cashflows (premiums less claims and expenses) received by fund managers can be checked against accounting data.

- Unusual values and spot checks, for example: ➢ Bonuses accrued should not exceed plausible levels based on historical declared rates ➢ Terms only 10 years ➢ No zeroes or missing values ➢ Ages at entry and start dates within expected ranges ➢ A paid-up policy should have a reduced sum assured and zero premium ➢ Only in-force policies

ii. Reserves valued using a cashflow projection:

- Project the expected cashflows in each future year, including: ➢ Premiums ➢ Claims ➢ Expenses including ongoing commission (if any)

- This should allow for all expected decrements, namely deaths, surrenders, paid ups, and maturities. F102 N2025 © Actuarial Society of South Africa

## Page 10

- Future new business is excluded.

- This is done per policy, or using appropriate grouped model points.

- The starting benefit amount is the basic sum assured plus all vesting reversionary bonuses to date.

- Allowance is made for expected future reversionary bonuses consistent with the expected investment returns on the assets backing the portfolio, ➢ as well as other considerations, such as company bonus philosophy and policyholder reasonable expectations.

- Allow for all guarantees if any, such as minimum surrender or maturity values.

- The expected future net outgo (claims + expenses - premiums) at each future time period is discounted to the present.

iii. Impact on solvency:

- The market value of equities will fall whereas the market value of bonds will rise.

- The overall impact will depend on the mix of assets held, which will depend on the maturity of the book and the split between terminal and reversionary bonuses.

- The reserves will increase due to the lower interest rates, all else being equal.

- The net effect may be a deterioration of the insurer's solvency position.

iv. Possible mitigating actions include:

- The insurer could apply temporary market value adjustments to surrender values.

- Terminal bonuses could be reduced, or removed entirely, if the impact of the crash is particularly severe.

- Depending on the outlook for recovery, future bonus rate assumptions could be reduced or deferred, reducing reserves.

- Policyholders' reasonable expectations must be considered when changing bonus structures.

- It might be possible, although likely costly, to adjust the investment portfolio temporarily to limit further potential losses (including the use of derivatives).

- If particularly severe, management may consider reducing non-essential expenses.

- If warranted, basis changes may be considered to weaken the basis and reduce reserves.

- If solvency is at risk, capital raising exercises may be considered, including use of financial reinsurance.

- The insurer could close to new business temporarily, thereby removing new business strain and avoiding a further deterioration in solvency in the short term. However, this will reduce profitability in the longer term.

- The insurer could consider closer matching its assets and liabilities to reduce the need for a mismatching reserve, however this may incur costs. Examiner's Comments Overall, this question was answered reasonably well. Strong candidates recognised that parts F102 N2025 © Actuarial Society of South Africa

## Page 11

(i) and (ii) were primarily bookwork, while weaker candidates tended to provide too few points
or presented their answers in a poorly structured manner.
For part (ii), many students focused excessively on describing valuation bases and margins rather than identifying the key cashflows. A common omission was the failure to account for bonuses within the model. Several students also incorrectly treated reserves as PV of inflows minus PV of outflows, rather than the correct formulation of PV of outgo minus PV of inflow.
Part (iii) was generally poorly answered, with many responses being overly prescriptive.
Statements suggesting that a particular outcome "will" occur were not credited--candidates were expected to discuss likelihoods rather than certainties. Many students also overlooked bonds in their explanations, and some made the fundamental error of failing to note that a decrease in interest rates increases present values.
Part (iv) was also weakly answered. Many candidates did not produce enough distinct points or repeated the same ideas. Additionally, several suggestions were made without consideration of their implications--for example, changes to investment strategy may carry significant cost.
QUESTION 5
i. Product features of an accumulating with-profits and a unit-linked product:

- Both an accumulating with-profits and unit-linked product have an explicit link between the premiums/contributions to date and the benefit payable to the policyholder.

- In the case of a unit-linked policy, the policyholders' contributions are invested into the chosen underlying fund and the policyholders fund value moves in line with the performance of the underlying fund. ➢ Fixed and fund-related charges may be deducted from the policyholder's fund and returns for calculating unit price may be net of asset management costs.

- For accumulating with-profits, the policyholder's premiums/contributions are accumulated over-time and bonuses are added to the fund value based on the bonuses declared by the insurer. ➢ Fixed and fund-related charges may be deducted from the policyholder's fund, and bonuses declared may be net of some costs (e.g. asset management).

- Bonuses declared may depend on the insurer's discretion or can be based on a pre-determined formula.

- While accumulating with-profit bonuses are generally smoothed over time to provide stable growth, reflecting past investment performance of the with-profit fund, they may also be influenced by historical bonuses declared and future expected investment return.

- The insurer may have various options available on the split between reversionary and terminal bonuses depending on the level of investment freedom and policyholder reasonable expectations. F102 N2025 © Actuarial Society of South Africa

## Page 12

- Special once-off bonuses can be applicable on the accumulating with-profits policies, particularly where there are materially higher returns which are not expected to repeat.

- For both products, surrender values are often stipulated as a function of the fund balance less surrender penalties.

- However, in the accumulating with-profits instance, market value adjustors might be applied in some circumstances in order to prevent anti selection.

ii. Setting assumptions:

- The company may start from prior experience investigations used for pricing or reserving.

- The company should consider the requirements of the regulator and any professional guidance.

- The assumptions should not be arbitrarily different from the previous valuation assumptions, and assumption changes should be suitably supported and documented and their impact disclosed.

- Unit fund growth: ➢ Determine an expected growth rate by asset class as a risk-free rate, probably based on government bonds of suitable term, plus a suitable risk premium that varies by asset class.

- The risk premiums could be based on past investment returns or a CAPM model for risky assets. ➢ The overall risk premium and expected growth rate is based on an expected split of unit funds by asset class based on the investment mandate of the fund. ➢ Prudence would require a lower unit growth rate.

- Demographic assumptions: ➢ Use recent own demographic experience based on investigations and adjusted for known or expected future changes. ➢ For surrenders (full or partial), a prudent assumption will likely be higher than best estimate given that it will reduce the future fund charges in excess of expenses and cost of benefits (assuming this excess is positive). ➢ The mortality assumption is not such a key assumption given that the additional death benefit is small and the mortality rates are likely to be low. May use standard mortality tables adjusted for experience. ➢ A higher than best estimate assumption will be prudent.

- Expenses: ➢ Use recent expense investigation i.e. the expenses allocated to this product. ➢ Need to allow for expected in force volumes to capture the spread of overhead. ➢ A higher than best estimate expense assumption is prudent.

- Inflation: ➢ Consider the main drivers for expense inflation - likely to be salary inflation. ➢ Use market and economic indicators and ensure consistency with the unit growth and discount rate assumptions. ➢ For a monetary policy fee, consider market indicators such as the relevant current and expected future consumer prices index. F102 N2025 © Actuarial Society of South Africa

## Page 13

➢ Prudent to assume higher expense inflation and lower consumer prices inflation (for the charges).

- Discount rate/valuation interest rate: ➢ Likely to consider yields on the assets backing the non-unit reserve. Likely to use a risk-free rate based on government bonds or cash. ➢ A lower rate is more prudent in the event of positive reserves. Examiner's Comments Candidates performed quite well on the question. Part (i) was largely bookwork and candidates were able to compare the two products appropriately. Part (ii) was generally well answered and candidates who did better were able to discuss a variety of assumptions and describe the margins required in order for it to be a prudent valuation.

QUESTION 6
i. Reasons for the new product:

- Competitive reasons: other insurers offer this product, or if they don't this may provide a competitive advantage - the insurer hopes to increase its overall sales.

- Enhance its brand - especially if no/few other insurers offer this product, customers may view the insurer as being innovative and a leader in the industry.

- Meeting customer needs better - increasing uncertainty about future inflation is increasing customer needs for products that provide some protection against higher inflation.

- Regulatory changes might now be creating a market (or bigger market) for this product - e.g. inclusion as a default product for pension schemes.

- Insufficient suitable assets in the market (i.e. fixed-interest bonds of adequate term) for matching without-profits liabilities - while the new product also has fixed guarantees they should be lower.

- Capital efficiency - fewer guarantees should require lower capital requirements, thus freeing up capital for other purposes. ➢ The product may lead to higher return on capital for shareholders - i.e. higher profitability.

ii. Suitable investments:

- The insurer would aim to match its assets and liabilities in terms of nature, term and currency to minimise investment risk. ➢ However, it may choose to mismatch to pursue higher returns if its free assets support this. F102 N2025 © Actuarial Society of South Africa

## Page 14

- The guaranteed benefits (comprising initial income plus declared increases) are fixed in monetary terms and hence: ➢ This may be best matched by government fixed interest bonds of suitable term. ➢ The insurer may invest in high-quality corporate bonds to enhance its returns, however, these carry default loss risk.

- Discretionary benefits (comprising future increases) are real in nature (and not index-linked) and hence best matched by: ➢ Index linked bonds will provide the minimum real return being targeted if they are held to maturity. ➢ Equity and property can be expected to provide positive real returns over longer time periods, although they will be associated with volatility over shorter periods.

- Expenses are mostly staff and IT-related and real in nature. ➢ This will be best matched by a combination of equity, property and index linked bonds.

- Cash would be held as working capital to meet short-term obligations.

- The insurer is likely to prefer direct investment, however this may be impractical for some types of assets such as property and offshore investment, in which case an indirect form of investment may be used.

iii. Key risks:

- Mortality risk - risk of mortality being lighter than expected: ➢ As this is a new product, the annuitant profile may differ from existing products. ➢ The scope for mortality improvements in a developing country may be difficult to quantify.

- Investment risk - risk of returns being lower than required: ➢ The insurer may not be able to match the CPI-linked increase for life. ➢ As this is a developing country, there may not be sufficient stock of indexlinked bonds of varying terms available in the local market. ➢ Default on ILBs will leave the insurer with insufficient assets to meet liabilities. ➢ Investment risk is exacerbated if mortality is lighter than expected as this may require re-investment at unknown future terms.

iv. Market option pricing techniques:

- Market prices of options replicating the guarantee are required.

- The GAO becomes valuable to the policyholder when real interest rates underlying CPI-linked annuities in the market drop below the guaranteed real rate implied by the GAO CPI-linked annuity price, hence market prices of options that may be used: ➢ Put option of suitable term (reflecting endowment term) on a real interest rate (of duration reflecting expected lifespan at GAO exercise date) with strike being equal to the guaranteed real interest rate. F102 N2025 © Actuarial Society of South Africa

## Page 15

➢ Call option of suitable term (reflecting endowment term) on an index-linked bond (of duration reflecting expected lifespan at GAO exercise date) with strike being equal to the ILB price corresponding to the guaranteed real interest rate.

- If market prices are not available estimates may be available from market participants.

- The expected cost of the GAO is also a function of projected maturity value of the unit-linked endowment assurance as this will determine the monetary amount of annuity purchased (and hence the number/amount of options needed to replicate the guarantee). ➢ A stochastic method, or a deterministic method with scenario/sensitivity testing, may be required to estimate projected maturity values under various scenarios for unit fund growth. Examiner's Comments Overall answers were disappointing. Part (i) answers contained a lot of repetitive points. Few thought of the new product requiring less capital and being potentially more profitable. Part (ii) answers varied from very weak to some good ones. A common issue was that candidates were often very vague about which portion of the liability was guaranteed and which was discretionary, and many neglected to state the nature of these. Some thought the benefits are guaranteed to increase by CPI, some referred to bonuses but it was not clear if they were referring to past or future bonuses, some referred to sums assured and terminal bonuses, and many didn't even consider the different liability components. Some thought that index-linked bonds (ILBs) can be used to match the guaranteed portion of the annuity, and some even suggested equity for the guaranteed portion. Some wrote about "bonds" without making clear if they were referring to fixed interest or index-linked bonds. Many seemed to think that corporate bonds are always index-linked when it is unlikely in this market (and even in developed markets it is highly unusual for companies to issue index-linked bonds). Some wrote about investing in the "index" (an index is not an investible asset). A few wrote about the assets needed for the free reserves. For part (iii) a concerning number of candidates thought that lapses is a key for annuities. Part (iv) answers were very disappointing. Many answers were a reproduction of bookwork and not adjusted for the CPI-linked annuity scenario (which will be backed by ILBs and not fixed-interest bonds), or they comprised vague and non-sensical statements that revealed a fundamental lack of understanding. Many assumed that in a swap the floating rate is a CPIlinked rate when in fact it is usually a money-market linked rate and would thus be unsuitable. Many candidates mentioned calls and puts in their answer but did not specify what instrument the derivative is based on (interest rate or price). F102 N2025 © Actuarial Society of South Africa

QUESTION 7
i. Factors to consider include:

- Average benefit level for the product and the expected distribution of the benefit.

- Company's insurance risk appetite.

- Level of the company's free assets and the importance attached to the stability of its free asset ratio.

- Terms on which reinsurance can be obtained and the dependence of such terms on the retention limit.

- Level of familiarity of the company with underwriting the type of business involved.

- Company's expertise in pricing such a product vis-à-vis the reinsurer's expertise.

- Any regulatory requirements with regards to minimum / maximum level of session.

- Effect on the company's regulatory capital requirements of increasing or reducing the retention limit.

- Existence of a profit-sharing arrangement in the reinsurance treaty.

- Company's retention on its other products.

- Nature of any future increases in sum assured.

ii. Reasons:

- Group schemes are typically repriced annually based on the most recent claims experience. This short feedback loop allows the reinsurer to adjust premiums quickly in response to emerging trends, reducing the long-term risk of pricing inadequacy. In contrast, individual IP policies often involve long-term guarantees, increasing pricing risk.

- Gondor Life can request quotes from multiple reinsurers each year. This competitive dynamic incentivises Rivendell Re to offer more attractive terms to retain the business, especially if the experience is favourable.

- The application of an FCL reduces the number of medically underwritten lives referred to the reinsurer. This lowers administrative costs and simplifies risk acceptance processes, which can be reflected in more competitive pricing.

- The group scheme likely comprises a sufficiently large number of members with similar risk characteristics--such as occupation (mining industry) and geographic location. This homogeneity allows for more accurate pricing through risk pooling.

- Compulsory membership ensures that both good risks and bad risks are gained, which reduces or eliminates anti-selection risk. This allows for better cross subsidising of risk and therefore will impact the actual claims costs.

- Benefits are determined by a fixed formula linked to salary, which prevents antiselection through over- or under-insurance. This design ensures that benefit levels are proportionate to earnings, aligning incentives and reducing moral hazard.

- Group schemes often include an "actively at work" requirement at inception. This acts as a proxy for good health, as individuals currently working are less likely to claim in the near term. This initial selection effect improves the expected claims ratio. F102 N2025 © Actuarial Society of South Africa

## Page 17

- With three years of claims experience available, Rivendell Re can perform a more informed actuarial analysis. This enhances pricing accuracy and may justify more favourable terms if the experience has been stable or better than expected.

iii. Reasons:

- Group schemes often lack detailed member-level data. In this case, Gondor Life is unlikely to provide: ➢ Full policy histories or transitions between health states. ➢ Information on lives entering or exiting claim during the deferred period. ➢ Recovery data or transitions back to premium-paying status. ➢ The available data is likely limited to basic demographic data (e.g., sex, date of birth, salary, NRA) and current claim information.

- Given the data constraints, a multi-state model would be impractical due to insufficient granularity of data.

- It focuses on estimating the expected cost of claims incepting in a given year, which aligns with the annual repricing cycle typical of group schemes.

- It simplifies the modelling process by separating the estimation of claim incidence rates from the expected duration and cost of claims via a disabled life annuity factor.

- For group schemes, members may enter and exit the scheme regularly as they change employers meaning that there may be even less information available about different states a member may be in over time.

- It is efficient to implement, especially when data is sparse or aggregated.

- It is flexible, allowing for adjustments based on emerging experience or changes in benefit design.

- It allows for the application of risk margins and loadings in a structured and justifiable manner. Examiner's Comments Overall performance on this question was mixed. Parts (i) and (ii) were generally better handled, while part (iii) was poorly answered by many candidates. A recurring issue across all sections was a lack of clarity and precision. For part (i) most candidates interpreted this section correctly and could identify several relevant factors influencing the setting of a reinsurance retention limit. However, a few candidates merely wrote down isolated words with no explanation of what point they were trying to make. In list questions, candidates still need to be explicit: the examiner must be able to see clearly what factor is being referred to. For part (ii) performance on this part was generally good, with most candidates correctly applying the principles to the specific context of a compulsory group income-protection arrangement. However, the most common weakness was that many candidates did not directly engage with the core intention of the question, namely: to explain why terms for a group scheme F102 N2025 © Actuarial Society of South Africa

may be more favourable than for individual IP policies. Instead, weaker answers drifted into generic comments about competitiveness or reinsurer behaviour, without contrasting group versus individual business.
Part (iii) was the weakest-scoring part of the question. A large proportion of candidates failed to identify the key rationale: namely, that the alternative to the chosen pricing approach would typically be a multi-state model, and that such a model is inappropriate or impractical given the limited, aggregate nature of group scheme data. Many answers simply described features of inception/disability annuity pricing without explaining why this method was chosen over the multi-state alternative.
QUESTION 8
i. Experience to monitor:
New business

- Monitor number of policies as well as the premiums and/or benefits.

- Since this is a recently established company, it will be important to achieve the sales targets. Lapses

- Monitor the lapses in terms of premiums and/or benefits.

- Higher than expected lapses will affect the insurer's revenues and profits.

- This may also indicate that there are other problems that need investigation e.g. the sales process or uncompetitive premiums. Engagement

- Monitor the data (if any) provided by each policyholder for benefit increase triggers. ➢ Or social media profile sharing from which such information might be gathered. ➢ Or how often the policyholder interacts with the app.

- This is needed to measure the success of the mobile phone app as a general means for interacting.

- The success of the take-up offer in particular depends on policyholders disclosing the necessary information. Take-up rates on offers made

- The percentage of offers taken up. ➢ Split by type and also the percentage of the total additional benefit take up.

- It may point to offers that are "too good" (i.e. potential anti-selection risk) or "too bad" (i.e. uncompetitive). F102 N2025 © Actuarial Society of South Africa

Mortality experience

- Compare actual vs expected for the entire portfolio and for benefit increases separately.

- As this is still likely to be a small portfolio, it may be difficult to understand the effect of random variation.

- Benefit increases should ideally be split by type and also the percentage of the total additional benefit take up. ➢ May be difficult to split into smaller categories until more policies are available to ensure credibility of each category.

- May provide early indications of anti-selection.

- May provide early indication of changes required to offer assumptions and pricing. Expenses

- Monitor against pricing assumptions and expense loadings.

- As well as against business plans.

- This is important for maintaining control over expenses based on the size of the book. ➢ Especially if the book is not growing according to the business plan.

ii. Conducting an expense analysis:

- Collect and summarise expenses for the last three years: salaries and related costs, property costs, computer costs, investment costs, marketing costs and commission.

- Start by classifying the company's non-commission expenses by department/function into: ➢ new business (or initial) expenses; ➢ existing business (or renewal) expenses; ➢ termination expenses; and ➢ investment expenses.

- Each of the first three can be further split according to whether the expense is proportional to: ➢ the number of policies written or in-force; ➢ the premiums written or in force; or ➢ the sum assured written or in force.

- This creates a series of 'cells' for dividing expenses into.

- Since there are only term assurance policies expenses do not have to be split between products.

- Administration costs, overheads and systems running costs could be split by costs associated with new business and costs associated with in-force business. ➢ Possibly proportional to the sum assured (or premium) for new business and the in-force business.

- Investment expenses can be allowed for by means of a reduction in the return on assets and thus do not constitute part of the per policy expense. F102 N2025 © Actuarial Society of South Africa

➢ It is unlikely to be a significant expense in this case as term assurance policies do not build-up large reserves and it is still early in the policy / company lifetime.

- Commission is generally known and can be excluded from the expense analysis and loaded explicitly.

- System development costs can be amortised over the expected lifetime of the system.

- The per policy costs can then be determined as: ➢ Initial expenses allocated divided by the amount of new business; ➢ Renewal expenses allocated divided by the amount of existing business; and ➢ Termination expenses divided by the number of terminations. Examiner's Comments In part (i) there were many points that could be made on monitoring that all insurance companies would want to do. Candidates received limited credit for generic points. The better solutions addressed the specific issues in the question i.e. a new company with limited experience, potentially random (good or bad) claims experience and a need to understand if their business/product is going to be successful. Part (ii) is a standard question, asked often, with small changes in application. While there were some excellent solutions, the solutions were generally disappointing. There was also some evidence of time pressure for this last question, indicating poor exam planning and/or discipline.

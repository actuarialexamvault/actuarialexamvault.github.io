## QUESTION 2

A mutual life office has large, established portfolios of with-profit and unit-linked endowment assurances. Surplus is distributed to the with-profits policies by means of terminal bonuses and annual compound reversionary bonuses, which are smoothed.
It has been suggested by an actuarial student that smoothing be reduced and that reversionary bonuses more closely reflect investment returns.
Discuss the implications of the suggested change in surplus distribution policy for the company and policyholders.

## QUESTION 4

SouthernRock is a large insurer specialising in credit life assurance on home loans.

i. List the checks you would carry out on the policy data for the purpose of reporting on the
alterations to policy terms.

ii. Describe how you would investigate the recent trends in the alteration experience.

iii. Describe how asset-liability modelling can be used to test the probability of insolvency for a
specific investment strategy.
[4]

iv. State what implications the lengthening in policy term is likely to have on the insurer's
investment strategy.

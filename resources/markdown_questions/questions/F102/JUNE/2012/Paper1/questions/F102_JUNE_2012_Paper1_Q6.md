## QUESTION 6

You are the product development actuary working for a life insurance company which focuses on the low income market in a developing country. You are designing a 10-year term assurance product that, in addition to a death benefit, pays policyholders a fixed lump sum for each day (beyond the third) they are hospitalised. Level monthly premiums are payable for the duration of the contract. Premiums are based on age at entry (to a maximum age of 60) and vary in 10-year age bands (i.e. 21-30, 31-40, etc.).
Initial underwriting is limited to two simple underwriting questions which aim to establish whether the policyholder is reasonably healthy at the time of applying for the contract and is not intending to seek medical advice in the three months following the application.
i. Describe the cross-subsidies that exist in this product design.
[4]

ii. Outline how the existence of cross-subsidies impacts on the factors that need to be considered
in designing the product.

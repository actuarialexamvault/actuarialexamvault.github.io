## QUESTION 8

A recently-established life insurance company intends to issue regular premium unit-linked individual income protection (long-term sickness) contracts. Several of the country's largest life offices have been involved in this market for some years.
Units will be cancelled regularly to meet the risk premiums and expense charges. The office will retain the right to vary the risk and expense charges to reflect experience, and office premiums are to be reviewed on a 5-yearly basis.
The risk benefit is a fixed amount to be determined at outset, but the policy also provides a premium waiver during a claim, with unit allocations and cancellations continuing. On death, surrender or at the end of the policy term the policyholder will receive the bid value of the units (although this is not expected to be a significant amount).
i. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed product design to the policyholder
compared with a traditional non-linked income protection (long-term sickness) product.
[6]

ii. List the major features on which income protection (long-term sickness) contracts are sold.
[2]

iii. Outline the risks faced by the life office in respect of expenses
[3]

iv. Suggest types of risk reinsurance which the office may wish to put in place, outlining the
reasons for each.

## QUESTION 4

You are an actuary working for a niche insurer specialising in critical illness products. Recently, the life assurance industry has been moving towards standardising the claim qualification criteria for the major causes of critical illness claims (i.e. heart attack, stroke, cancer and coronary artery bypass surgery claims). Up to now, the only product sold by your company has been a simple stand-alone critical illness product that covers the four conditions above without any tiered benefits. You are instructed to start work on a new stand-alone critical illness product that only covers these four conditions, but includes three levels of tiered benefits.
i. Outline the advantages of this standardising of claim criteria across the industry.
[4]

ii. Discuss how the product design and pricing requirements differ between the new and existing
product.
[5]

iii. Comment on the merits of the statement that tiered critical illness products would always be
cheaper than non-tiered products.

## QUESTION 5

A proprietary South African life insurer sells a range of conventional ("additions to benefits") withprofits products. Shareholders receive 10% of all bonuses declared by the company. Recent returns have been poor on the with-profits funds due to a global recession and interest rates in the market are at an all-time low. The statutory actuary has, however, been conservative in the past years by declaring low reversionary bonuses. Historically surplus has been mainly distributed through the terminal bonus. The with-profits funds have thus remained with strong free asset positions.
In performing the recent valuation an error is discovered in the way in which the asset shares have been calculated historically. As a result of this data error, the asset shares have been significantly overstated. The error is rectified and a large portion of the free assets have been eliminated as a result of the error.
i. Describe how asset shares should be calculated.
[3]

ii. Describe the different ways in which bonuses can be declared under the
conventional "additions to benefits" method and which sources of surplus are best distributed by each type of bonus.
[3]

After informing the necessary stakeholders of the impact of the error, the statutory actuary requests a change in the bonus strategy of the company.
iii. Discuss the likely impact on policyholders and shareholders of adopting each of the following
strategies: a. Declaring lower reversionary bonuses for the next few years. b. Decreasing the terminal bonuses.

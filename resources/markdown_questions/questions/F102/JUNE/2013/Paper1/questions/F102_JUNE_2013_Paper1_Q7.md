## QUESTION 7

A life insurance company is considering the alteration basis it should use for its without-profits endowment assurance business.
i. When setting a surrender value basis, explain how the relationship between:

- the prospective reserve using the original pricing basis;

- the prospective reserve using a realistic basis; and

- the earned asset share will give an indication of the profit extracted on the surrender.

[5]

It is proposed that if a policyholder wishes to reduce the sum assured on this product, a revised premium will be calculated as follows: A premium will be calculated on the current premium basis for the new sum assured, but then reduced by an amount equivalent to the surrender value, if any, of the original product spread over the remaining premium payment period (using the original pricing basis).
The surrender value is:

- zero at early policy durations, and

- equal to the prospective reserve on the pricing basis of the original product, when this value is positive.

ii. Discuss the suitability of this proposal.

## QUESTION 8

A small, recently-established proprietary life office intends to launch ten-year unit-linked endowment assurance policies which provide the following benefits:

- A guaranteed sum assured (or the bid value of the unit fund, if higher) payable on the first of death, maturity or the diagnosis of one of a stated list of critical illnesses.

- The bid value of the unit fund less a penalty, payable on surrender. Premiums and charges operate as follows:

- Level monthly premiums will be payable throughout.

- The first year's premiums will be allocated to buying capital units (with an annual management charge of 6%), with subsequent premiums buying accumulation units (with an annual management charge of 1%).

- The only other charges on the policy are to be the monthly risk benefit charges, which will be based on the sum at risk each month and will be deducted from the unit fund.

- The level of the risk benefit charges is not guaranteed beyond the first year.

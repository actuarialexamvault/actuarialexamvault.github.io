## QUESTION 1

LL Life Assurance is a medium-sized profitable life insurance company with a sizeable in-force book of term and whole life assurances.

i. Explain how asset-enhancing reinsurance may be used to fund the expansion and why this
might be preferable to obtaining a loan.

ii. Outline the reasons for LL Life Assurance to consider entering into a proportional reinsurance
arrangement on the CI product.

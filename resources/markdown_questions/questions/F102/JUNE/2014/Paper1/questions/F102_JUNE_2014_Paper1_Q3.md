## QUESTION 3

A medium-sized life insurance company operating in a developing country, where there is a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, sells conventional life assurance business targeted at the middle and upper income segments.
There is a growing demand in the country for interest-only mortgage loans in this market segment.
The company plans to launch a new unit-linked endowment assurance product aimed at providing death and maturity benefits for people taking out these interest-only mortgage loans. The product will be sold through independent intermediaries.
The new product will have the following characteristics:

- Death benefit: The higher of the value of the mortgage and the value of the unit fund.

- Surrender value: The value of the unit fund less a surrender penalty.

- Maturity benefit: The value of the unit fund.

- Term: Duration of the mortgage.

- Allocation rate 90% throughout.

- Risk benefit charge (in respect of any excess of the guaranteed sum assured over the value of units in the unit fund): Variable at the discretion of the insurer.

- Other charges: None.

- Premiums: Level monthly premiums (guaranteed for first 5 years).

- The investment portfolio of the unit fund has been selected so that the accumulated unit fund at maturity will cover the initial mortgage at a reasonably conservative rate of unit growth.

## QUESTION 4

A life office sells conventional without-profit life assurance policies. These policies were originally sold to high-income individuals through independent brokers. Six years ago the insurer entered into a relationship with a bank with middle-income clients, where bank sales staff sell policies from the existing product suite. The insurer has experienced high sales volumes from bank customers and has been experiencing high levels of requests for policy alterations from these customers.
i. Comment briefly on the appropriateness of the following proposed bases for each of the
alterations to recurring premium policies described below. a. A policyholder wishes to halve his premium four years into a 20-year endowment assurance policy and reduce the term by 5 years.
The company plans to take the retrospective earned asset share and apply this as a single premium to secure benefits under the altered policy. The single premium rate to be used will be the normal single premium for a similar new policy, and the extra benefits arising from future premiums will be secured at normal premium rates. A specific deduction will be made from the asset share to cover the administrative costs of the alteration.
[2]

b. A policyholder wishes to halve his sum assured five years into a 10-year term assurance policy.
The company plans to equate policy values before and after the alteration on a realistic prospective basis, except for a realistic allowance for the cost of the alteration which will be deducted from the policy value before the alteration.
[2]

c. A policyholder wishes to double his premium six years into a 20-year endowment
assurance policy.
The company plans to equate policy values before and after the alteration on the original premium basis for the altered contract.
[2]

The insurer's distribution manager has suggested that the insurer should develop new tailored term assurance and endowment assurance products for bank customers. You have been given the task of setting the assumptions for the new products.
ii. Describe briefly the process that you would follow in setting the withdrawal assumptions for
the new endowment assurance product.

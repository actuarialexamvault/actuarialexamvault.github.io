## QUESTION 5

You work for a young life insurance company which sells whole life and critical illness policies. The insurer uses a direct distribution channel focusing on out-bound sales. The company buys lists of credit-card and store-card holders (referred to as 'leads') containing the contact details of the cardholder. The life insurance company's call centre then contacts these individuals telephonically in an attempt to sell life insurance policies to them.
i. The insurer has decided to use a limited set of underwriting questions, on the strength of
which it will accept, decline or limit the benefits.
Suggest possible information about the customer that could be gathered using these questions and comment on how this underwriting should be included in the telephonic sales process.
[3]

One of the concerns of the business manager is that not every lead is converted into a call and not every call is converted into a sale. He is eager to assess whether this distribution approach is successful and to investigate whether there are ways to improve the process. He has commissioned an investigation into the sales experience and has proposed using the ratio of the number of sales to the number of calls as a starting point for analysing the experience.
ii. Suggest, with justification, another simple ratio that could be used to analyse the sales
experience.
[1]

iii. List factors that could be used by the insurer to divide the past sales experience data into
homogeneous groups.
[4]

iv. Explain why it is important for the company to monitor this sales experience.

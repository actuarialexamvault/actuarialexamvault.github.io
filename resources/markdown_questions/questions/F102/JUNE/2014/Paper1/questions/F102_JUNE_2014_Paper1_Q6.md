## QUESTION 6

The insurance regulator of a particular country has commissioned a review of insurance regulations and the insurance industry, with a view to implementing a tighter regulatory regime.
i. List typical restrictions that a regulator can impose on the business of life insurers, over and
above reserving and solvency requirements and asset limitations.
[4]

The findings of the review indicated that competition in the market for savings products provided by insurers is not optimal. The regulator has stated that one of the main reasons for this is that the charging structures of savings products are too complicated, which makes a like-for-like comparison of the costs of the various providers' savings products too difficult.
The regulator has proposed that only two types of charges should be allowed on new savings products, namely a monetary amount per month and a percentage of premium(s), both of which must be level for the full duration of the policy. Providers could determine the level of the charge.
ii. Discuss the potential impact of this proposal on the factors that an actuary would consider
when designing a product. Assume that the savings products do not offer any protection benefits.

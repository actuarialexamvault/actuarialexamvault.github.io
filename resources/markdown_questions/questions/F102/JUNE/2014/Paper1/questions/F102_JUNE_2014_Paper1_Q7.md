## QUESTION 7

A life company that sells only conventional (additions to benefits) with-profits endowment assurance business has been using the Gross Premium Valuation method to calculate its reserves using a formula approach. The valuation actuary is considering changing to a discounted value of future cashflows method for calculating its reserves.
i. Outline the advantages and disadvantages to the company of using a cashflow method over
the formula method to calculate its reserves.
[4]

The marketing director has received numerous complaints about the level of the (compound) reversionary bonuses declared by the company. Reversionary bonus levels have consistently been 4% per annum. Inflation has steadily increased over recent years to 6% per annum, where it is widely expected to remain in the future. The office premium is based on an investment return of 5% per annum, while returns have been, and are expected to remain, 10% per annum. The formula method does not make explicit allowance for future bonuses, and uses a discount rate of 5% per annum.
Assume that all other experience items are similar for both the premium and valuation bases. The marketing director proposes that (compound) reversionary bonuses should be increased to 6% per annum.

ii. Comment on the feasibility of the marketing director's proposal.

iii. State the principles of investment that a life insurer should adhere to when determining its
investment strategy.

iv. Discuss the appropriateness of the company's investment strategy and comment on the
marketing director's suggestion, given the current level of surplus assets. State briefly how your answer would differ if the surplus assets were equal to the minimum solvency requirement prescribed by the regulator.

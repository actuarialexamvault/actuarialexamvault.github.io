## QUESTION 2

Insurers writing with-profits business, in a certain country, have traditionally followed the additions to benefits approach in order to distribute profits to policyholders. It is market practice to invest the assets backing with-profits business mainly in equities and to declare low reversionary bonuses and high terminal bonuses.
i. Outline briefly the factors that the insurer should take into account when considering the level
of terminal bonuses to be declared in any given year.
[3]

ii. Describe in detail the gross premium valuation method for determining the supervisory
reserves for with-profits policies.

There has been a market crash and a number of insurers have declared nil terminal bonuses for the year. This has resulted in a number of complaints from policyholders to the insurance regulator.
iii. State requirements that the regulator could put in place to reduce the risk of with-profits
policyholders being, or perceiving to be, treated unfairly.

## QUESTION 4

An established life insurance company has traditionally sold a wide range of protection and savings products to the upper- and middle-income market. The company plans to introduce a regular premium 15-year unitised with-profits savings product to be sold to lower-income government employees, marketed as a product to save for a child's tertiary education. The proposed features of the product are as follows:

- Maturity benefit: Accumulated premiums plus regular and terminal bonuses (bonuses may not be negative).

- Surrender benefit: Accumulated premiums plus regular bonuses less a surrender penalty and a market value reduction, if applicable.

- Partial withdrawal benefit: A maximum of two partial withdrawals after the first five years of the policy, of not more than 20% of the accumulated premiums plus regular bonuses.

- Death benefit: None, on the death of the policyholder the policy could be surrendered or be converted to paid-up unless there is a waiver of premium benefit as outlined below.

- Charges: Premium allocation rate, fixed per premium policy fee and an annual fund management charge.

- Optional benefit (for an additional premium): Waiver of future premium on death or permanent disability of the policyholder, with minimal underwriting required.

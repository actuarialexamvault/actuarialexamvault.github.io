## QUESTION 5

A popular product in a particular country is a regular premium, unit-linked savings product with a term of 10 years. The only permissible product charge is a level fund management charge. On surrender, a surrender penalty is deducted from the value of units. The maximum commission payable on the sale of such products, as prescribed in the insurance regulations, is a single upfront amount equal to twice the annual premium.
The regulatory authority is considering revising the insurance regulations for these savings products as follows:

- Disallowing any surrender penalties.

- Setting the maximum commission payable to:

- an upfront amount equal to the annual premium; plus

- a recurring amount of 10% of each regular premium (paid to the advisor on receipt of the premium in each year after the first). The product design actuary has recommended the following changes to the design of the product to accommodate the changes in regulations:

- increasing the fund management charge from the current level of 2% p.a. to 4% p.a.; and

- refunding 50% of the charges deducted over the term of the contract on maturity (applicable only to the maturity benefit). Discuss the suitability of the proposed changes to product design (including those required by the revised regulations), in terms of the relevant product design factors.

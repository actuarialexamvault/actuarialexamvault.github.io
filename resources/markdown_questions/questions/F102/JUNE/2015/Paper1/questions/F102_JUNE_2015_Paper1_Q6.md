## QUESTION 6

A life insurer selling regular premium without-profits endowment assurances has recently performed an experience investigation. The results of this investigation indicate that the insurer has had more surrenders at early durations than expected, and as a result it is making losses on surrenders. The insurer is considering making changes to its surrender value basis to minimise the negative impact of these early surrenders.
i. Describe a general approach to setting surrender values and suggest, with reasons, the
approach this insurer might adopt.
[10]

ii. Explain how the assumptions for interest, expenses, inflation and mortality will be determined
for the purpose of setting a prospective surrender value basis.

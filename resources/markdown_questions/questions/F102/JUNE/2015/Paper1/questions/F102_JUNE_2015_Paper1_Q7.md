## QUESTION 7

You are a newly qualified actuary and have just been appointed as the actuary responsible for product development, pricing and reinsurance at a small mutual insurer in a developed country where HIV is not a concern to insurers. The insurer's Board of Directors has identified the need to aggressively grow the number of members to ensure the sustainability of the mutual. The mutual has decided that the best way to achieve this is to use the direct-to-consumer approach through the internet, selling a regular premium without-profit term assurance product.
i. Describe briefly the various ways in which a reinsurer could assist the mutual with this plan.

ii. Outline how you would structure the underwriting for this product.

iii. Explain how the pricing for this new product will differ from that for the regular premium
without-profit term assurance product that the mutual currently sells through its own salesforce.

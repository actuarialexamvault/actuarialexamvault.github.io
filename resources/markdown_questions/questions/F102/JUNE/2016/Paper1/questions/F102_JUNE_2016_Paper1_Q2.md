## QUESTION 2

An insurer is planning to add a new benefit to its product range, namely a critical illness benefit. This benefit, like others from this insurer, will be unit-linked. The benefit is offered on the following terms:

- Guaranteed lump sum benefit on occurrence of one of the critical illnesses as defined in the policy document

- The benefit payable on death or maturity is the value of the unit fund (if positive)

- The surrender value is equal to the bid value of units less a surrender penalty (if positive)

- Units can be purchased in a wide range of investment funds

- Risk charges and management charges are deducted monthly from the unit fund to cover the cost of the critical illness benefit and expenses, respectively

- Premiums are calculated such that the unit fund is projected to be equal to the sum insured at the maturity date, under prudent assumptions

i. Outline the benefits that are provided, and the policyholder needs that are met, by such a
product.
[3]

ii. Outline the investment-related risks to the insurer of this product and how such risks can be
mitigated.
[5]

After consulting with brokers, the company now plans to offer a minimum guaranteed unit fund on death or maturity based on an investment return (before taxes and charges) equal to 3% p.a., in an environment where CPI is expected to be around 3% p.a.
iii. Outline both how this benefit change increases the risks to the insurer, and ways to mitigate
these risks.

## QUESTION 3

A company has a large book of without-profit critical illness business, which is 100% reinsured on a risk premium basis.
i. List the risk factors which can be used to classify the critical illness data into homogeneous
groups for a claims experience investigation.
[3]

Each year the company's actuarial team spends a significant amount of time investigating the claims experience on all of the company's products, including the above-mentioned critical illness product. A manager in the company has made the following comment regarding this book of critical illness business. "Since this business is fully reinsured, the company is not exposed to any morbidity risk on it.
This book should thus be excluded from future investigations into claims experience, as the claim investigation results for this product do not add value to the company. This change will also save the actuarial team a significant amount of time."
ii. Discuss the manager's statement, noting areas where these investigations might add value.

## QUESTION 4

You are a product design actuary working for a large insurance company with a significant existing book of immediate annuity business. Historically, only age and gender have been used as rating factors when determining the single premium for annuities in this market.
The regulatory authority in this country has expressed concern that the current market practice leads to poor value for money for the low income market. The regulator suggested that socio-economic class should be introduced as an additional rating factor. A small specialist annuity writer recently launched such a product and you now want to launch a competing product.
i. Explain briefly why the current market practice may lead to poor value for money for the low
income market.
[1]

ii. Discuss briefly the factors that you will consider when designing your company's annuity

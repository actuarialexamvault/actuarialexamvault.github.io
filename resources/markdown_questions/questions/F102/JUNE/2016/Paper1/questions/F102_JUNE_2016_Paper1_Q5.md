## QUESTION 5

A life insurance company allows its without-profits endowment assurance policyholders to extend the terms of their policies on request. The new premium payable after such an alteration is calculated by equating present values before and after the alteration, on the current premium basis (which may differ from the policy's original premium basis).
Outline the factors that the company would have considered in assessing the suitability of this method for calculating the altered premium.

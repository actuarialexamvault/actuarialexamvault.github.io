## QUESTION 6

The insurance supervisor in a well-developed life insurance market has introduced a new regime for valuing policyholder liabilities and calculating the solvency margin for life insurers. Policyholder liabilities are calculated using a market-consistent approach using best estimate assumptions and the minimum solvency margin is determined using a value-at-risk measure that will ensure that the assets will be sufficient to cover the liabilities at a 99.5% level of confidence over a one-year time horizon.
i. Describe the market-consistent method for determining the provisions for the policyholder
liabilities for life insurers.
[7]

ii. Explain why the insurance supervisor requires life insurers to maintain a minimum solvency
margin and explain the relationship between the strength of the provisions for policyholder liabilities and minimum solvency margin requirements.
[2]

The new solvency regime requires insurers to apply a set of stress tests to their assets and liabilities.
These stress tests are selected to reflect extreme cases of risk events for life insurers. A medium-sized insurer offering a range of life products in this market has calculated the additional solvency margin required under each of four individual stress tests. These amounts are as follows: Mortality stress test: $3 million Longevity stress test: $2 million Market stress test: $4.5 million Default of reinsurers: $0.5 million
iii. Explain why the aggregated amount of additional solvency margin for these risks should be
less than $10 million for this insurer, including in the explanation a description of how the aggregated solvency margin could be calculated.

## QUESTION 7

You are the senior pricing actuary at a large life insurance company in a well-established market.
Your company has written group income protection policies for the last 20 years. It is now considering entering the individual life (without-profits) income protection market. All sales will be made through intermediaries, who are either tied agents or independent brokers. The State does not offer any income protection benefits to individuals.
i. Outline briefly how the underwriting of the individual life product will differ from that of the
group product.
[2]

ii. List the factors defining the benefit, and the assumptions that you would require, to price the
new individual life income protection product.
[7]

iii. Outline how you would go about setting the claim inception and termination rates for pricing
the individual life income protection product, explaining to what extent the data from the company's group product may be relevant.

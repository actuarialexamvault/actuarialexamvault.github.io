## QUESTION 1

You are the senior pricing actuary at a large sub-Saharan life insurance company. One of the company's main risk products is a without-profits whole of life insurance with no surrender value, sold through independent intermediaries. The company has sold this product for several decades. Due to the company's relatively strict underwriting the premium rates are very competitive.
The company is planning to launch a direct offering of the whole of life insurance within the next 12 months. You expect the average sum insured to be less than half of that on the existing product. The company intends to do all of the underwriting on-line and through a call centre. The product will be marketed through mass media advertising (television, radio, newspaper, internet) as well as through mobile phone SMS campaigns.
i. List 8 key parameters that you would require assumptions for in order to price the new
product.

ii. Outline how you would set the assumptions for the parameters listed in (i), with specific
emphasis on the three most important parameters.

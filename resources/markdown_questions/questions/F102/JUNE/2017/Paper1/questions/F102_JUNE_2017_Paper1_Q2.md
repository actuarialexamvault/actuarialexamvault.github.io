## QUESTION 2

i. Describe briefly the two methods which could be used for allocating bonuses to the unit fund
for a unitised with-profits (UWP) contract.
[1]

ii. Explain the key differences between UWP and unit-linked contracts.
[3]

A UWP single premium product with a term of 15 years allocates bonuses to policyholders' unit funds through a mixture of regular and terminal bonuses. The product provides:

- A death benefit of the value of the unit fund subject to a minimum of a return of the premium.

- A maturity benefit of the accumulated fund value including any regular and terminal bonuses.

- A surrender benefit equal to the accumulated fund value less a pre-determined surrender penalty. No Market Value Adjustment is applied to a surrender. The following charges are levied on the policy: a bid-offer spread, annual management charge and a charge for risk benefits.

iii. Describe how a cashflow model could be used to determine the value of the expected future
profit from the in-force UWP business.

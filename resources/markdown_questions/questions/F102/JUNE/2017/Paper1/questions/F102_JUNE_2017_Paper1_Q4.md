## QUESTION 4

i. Outline briefly the principles that a life insurance company should follow when setting
surrender values.
[4]

It is proposed that the surrender values for a new conventional without-profit whole life product be determined using a blended approach based on:

- Retrospective values (based on the asset share) at early durations; and

- Prospective values using assumptions (based on the current premium basis) at later durations. The surrender values will not be guaranteed and projected surrender values are not included in disclosures to policyholders.

ii. Explain how such a blended approach would meet the principles outlined in (i).
[5]

iii. Outline ways in which the approach to setting surrender values could be changed in order to
increase the profit made on surrenders.

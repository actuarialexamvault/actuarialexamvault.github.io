## QUESTION 7

A large well-capitalised insurer with a wide product range has recently launched an annuallyrenewable funeral insurance product covering the policyholder and his/her immediate family members. The product targets low income customers and will be sold through funeral parlours on a voluntary basis. The product has been initially priced assuming the same probability of claim for all individuals covered by adjusting the mortality assumption for a similar product sold to the lowermiddle income market. The business model relies on salaried agents of the insurer for the marketing and ongoing servicing of the product to funeral parlours.
i. Outline the mortality, persistency and expense risks that the insurer faces relating to this
product.
[7]

The insurer has been losing money on this product for the last four years.
ii. Outline briefly various investigations which the insurer could perform in order to understand
the factors causing the losses.
[5]

The investigations performed by the insurer have indicated that higher than expected mortality and lower than expected retentions have caused the losses.
iii. Suggest four actions, for each of these two problem areas, which could be taken by the insurer
to address the poor experience.

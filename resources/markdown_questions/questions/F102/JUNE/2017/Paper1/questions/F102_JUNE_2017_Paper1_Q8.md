## QUESTION 8

i. Define long term care insurance.
[2]

A life insurance company in a developed country currently sells mainly regular premium unit-linked whole life assurance contracts. Mortality improvements in the country have been greater than expected by the insurance industry over the past decade The insurer is considering introducing an optional long term care rider to its regular premium unitlinked whole life assurances. It is proposed that the combined new product will have the following features.

- The surrender value will be the bid value of the units less a surrender penalty.

- The death benefit will be the bid value of the units.

- The long term care benefit will be an annuity purchased at the prevailing annuity rates in the market (at the time of a claim) using the full bid value of the units. The annuity will be subject to a guaranteed minimum monthly amount, which will be selected at the time of purchasing the rider.

- If a policyholder claims the long term care benefit the unit fund will reduce to zero and will start building up again (through the continuing payment of premiums) until subsequent surrender or death.

- The long term care rider will only be available to individuals aged below 50 effecting new policies.

ii. Discuss the key factors to be considered by the insurer when assessing the suitability of the
proposed product design.

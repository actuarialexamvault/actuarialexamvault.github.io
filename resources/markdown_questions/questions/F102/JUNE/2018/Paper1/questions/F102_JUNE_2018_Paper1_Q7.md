## QUESTION 7

i. List the assumptions that need to be made when valuing a mortality option using a cashflow
projection model.
[2]

A life insurance company sells a 10-year unit-linked regular premium endowment assurance with the following characteristics:

- Policyholders undergo full medical underwriting at inception.

- Unit funds are invested in a variety of different asset classes.

- There is a guaranteed maturity value, expressed in Rand terms.

- There is a guaranteed minimum death benefit that remains level throughout the policy term, expressed in Rand terms.

- In addition to the above-mentioned minimum death benefit, policyholders have the option to double their death benefit at the policy's five year anniversary, without undergoing further medical underwriting. The mortality charges for the additional benefit are guaranteed to be the same as for lives that are fully underwritten at that point in time. For this product the company has implemented the following risk mitigating measures:

- The guaranteed maturity value is matched with derivative instruments.

- The administration of this business is outsourced to a third party administration company that has guaranteed the costs of administering the business, including a guarantee regarding the rate at which the administration costs may increase in future.

ii. Describe the company's exposure to mortality risk under this product.

iii. Outline the non-mortality risks that the company is exposed to under this product.

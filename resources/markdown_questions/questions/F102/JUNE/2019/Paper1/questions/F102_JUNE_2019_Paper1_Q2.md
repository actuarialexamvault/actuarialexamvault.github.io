## QUESTION 2

Forsure is the market-leading life insurer in Actuaria and holds a significant portfolio of term assurance, whole of life and annuity policies. It has decided to review the mortality rates used to price its products.
i. Outline how the chief pricing actuary would go about setting the mortality assumptions.
[7]

A landmark constitutional court ruling in Actuaria has determined that life and health insurers are no longer able to use medical information as a rating factor for setting premiums, and that insured lives must pay the same premium (for the same benefits) regardless of their state of health, all other rating factors being equal.
ii. Describe the impact that this ruling may have on Foresure's existing and new business.
[5]

iii. Outline the effects that this ruling may have on the mortality experience of Forsure over the
short-, medium- and long term.

[3]

iv. Suggest ways in which Forsure can discourage unhealthy lives, or attract healthier lives, in the
absence of medical underwriting.

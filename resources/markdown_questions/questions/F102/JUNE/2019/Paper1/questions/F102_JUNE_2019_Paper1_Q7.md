## QUESTION 7

A man is considering taking out an 18-year, regular premium, endowment assurance to provide for his new-born daughter's tertiary education. He would like to receive at least R1 million in maturity benefits.
He is considering investing in a with-profit product with an initial sum assured of R500 000 payable in the event of death or maturity.
Companies A, B and C operate in the local life insurance market, and all offer conventional with-profit endowment assurance policies.

- Company A distributes surplus by means of regular, simple reversionary bonuses.

- Company B distributes surplus by means of regular, compound reversionary bonuses as well as by terminal bonuses which vary by term and duration.

- Company C distributes surplus by methods other than increasing the benefits.

i. Discuss why Company B's endowment assurance policy may be expected to have a higher
maturity value than Company A's.
[4]

ii. Suggest how Company C is likely to be distributing surplus, and explain briefly why this is
unlikely to be an appropriate option for the man.
[2]

iii. Outline other considerations that the man should take into account when deciding between a
policy from Company A and one from Company B.
[4]

Assume that the man survives to the end of the term of the endowment assurance policy, and that Company B declares a terminal bonus at maturity of 25% of attaching bonus only.
iv. Calculate the average annual bonus rates that Companies A and B would have to declare for
the man to receive his targeted maturity benefit.

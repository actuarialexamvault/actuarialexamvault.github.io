## QUESTION 8

The insurance regulator in a developing country has commissioned the industry association to develop standardised features for two single premium retirement income products:

- Conventional level annuity, guaranteed for the life-time of the policyholder.

- Unit-linked "income drawdown" product, where the single premium (less initial fees) is invested in one of a range of investment funds, as selected by the policyholder. The policyholder selects a percentage, subject to a specified maximum, of the fund value to be received every month. This percentage may be changed at each policy anniversary. Management charges will be deducted from the fund on a monthly basis.

Individual insurers are expected to determine their own annuity rates and charging structures for these standardised products.
i. Outline briefly, for each of the products above:
a. the benefits to the policyholder; and b. the risks remaining with the policyholder.

The insurance regulatory authority is developing a guidance note on the unit pricing of the internal unitlinked funds for the "income drawdown" product.
ii. Describe the approach to the calculation of the appropriation price as it would be covered in the
guidance note.

Phoenix Life is planning to offer a unit-linked "income drawdown" product. The company intends to offer three investment funds and charge the same monthly management charge for all funds.
iii. Explain how the insurer could use a model to determine the level of the monthly management
charge for this product.

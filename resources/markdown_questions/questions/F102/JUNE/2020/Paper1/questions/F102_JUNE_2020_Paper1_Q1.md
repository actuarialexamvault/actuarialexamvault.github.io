## QUESTION 1

A life insurer in a developing country has been selling single-premium deferred annuities for a number of years. The features of the product are summarised below:

- The product is sold on a without-profit basis;

- Regular annuity payments are level and paid from age 65 for the remaining life-time of the annuitant; and

- The level of the annuity is determined when the single premium is paid.

i. Describe the most suitable investments for matching the liabilities.
[5]

The new marketing manager has suggested that in order to make the product more attractive and improve sales she would like to add an option that can be exercised by deferred annuitants at age 65 to allow them to convert future income into an immediate lump sum at the guaranteed conversion rate of R10 per R1 p.a. of annuity income given up.
ii. Explain how the insurer could calculate the cost of offering this option.

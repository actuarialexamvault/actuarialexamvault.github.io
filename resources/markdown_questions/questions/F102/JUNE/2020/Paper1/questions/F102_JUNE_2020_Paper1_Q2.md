## QUESTION 2

i. State 4 reasons why a life insurer would monitor experience.
[2]

Forsure is the leading life insurer in a particular country and holds a significant portfolio of term assurance, whole of life and annuity policies. It has decided to review the per policy expense experience underlying its product offering.
Forsure operates a head office in each of the country's two main cities, Mortalitown and Longevitown.
The Longevitown office performs all the functions associated with the annuity business while the Mortalitown office performs all the functions associated with the assurance business, as well as the group-wide functions of the executive, marketing and actuarial teams.
Forsure operates one administration platform for signing up new business and administering in-force policies. However, it operates two distinct claims administration systems - one for assurance claims and another for annuity payments. The annuity payment system was developed and implemented in the past financial year.

ii. Describe how a pricing actuary would go about conducting a per policy experience analysis for
expenses and, in particular, how this would be done by Foresure's pricing actuary.

## QUESTION 3

A large established life insurer has been selling a comprehensive critical illness product for many years.
i. Outline briefly the customer needs that a critical illness product could potentially meet.
[3]

ii. Explain why, in practice, the critical illness benefit payouts might not correspond well to the
needs, as outlined above.
[3]

As a response to increased competition in the market, the insurer is considering launching a tiered version of its critical illness product, offering additional lower sum assured tiers of benefits for less serious forms of the illnesses currently covered. Several insurers in the market have been selling such a version of the product for a number of years.
iii. Describe the factors that the pricing actuary should consider when setting the risk rates for this
new option.
[5]

iv. Discuss how the reinsurance strategy for the tiered product may differ from that for the standard
critical illness product.

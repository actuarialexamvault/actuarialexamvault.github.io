## QUESTION 5

You are the head of the valuations team for a large listed insurance company, operating in a developing economy. The company sells conventional without-profits and with-profits policies, as well as unitlinked policies.
i. Describe how you would value the company's large, well-established, portfolio of withoutprofits whole of life assurance liabilities, on a market consistent basis for the purpose of
determining the financial position of the company for the published accounts.
[5]

The company's portfolio of endowment assurance policies has historically been quite small and has always been valued on a net premium basis. It has, however, grown substantially in the last three years and although it remains a small portion of the company liabilities, the CEO has asked you to use a less outdated valuation method for the published accounts. He has suggested using a more realistic gross premium valuation approach.
ii. Comment on the impact that the CEO's suggestion may have on the company's profitability
shown in the published accounts.
[3]

Subsequent to the accounts being published shareholders request a meeting to discuss the change in valuation approach.
iii. Outline the potential areas of concern for the shareholders.

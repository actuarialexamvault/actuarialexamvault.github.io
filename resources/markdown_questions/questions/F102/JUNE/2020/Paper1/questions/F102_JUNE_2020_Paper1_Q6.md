## QUESTION 6

Epsilon Life offers a range of conventional without-profits endowment assurances and whole of life assurances. The company allows policyholders to make their whole of life and endowment assurance policies paid-up with a reduced sum assured. Paid-up policyholders have the option to reinstate their policies at any time in the future, with a sum assured not exceeding the original sum assured, should they resume premium payments.
Epsilon Life calculates all post-alteration benefits and premiums by equating policy values of the prospective reserve after the alteration with the policy's prospective reserve immediately before the alteration, allowing for alteration expenses. Both prospective reserves are determined on a realistic basis.
You have been asked to determine the premium required to reinstate a paid-up whole of life assurance policy to its original sum assured.

i. Outline how the various assumptions required to carry out the calculation could be set,
commenting on how these assumptions may differ in the calculation of the policy values immediately before and after the reinstatement.
[6]

ii. Comment on the suitability of Epsilon Life's approach to determining post-reinstatement
benefits and premiums compared to the general principles which should be considered for policy alterations.

## QUESTION 7

A large life insurance company has written a wide range of unit-linked business for many years. A popular product for the middle-income market is the "Education Savings Plan", a regular premium unitlinked endowment assurance designed as a savings policy for parents to save for the tertiary education of their children. The key features of the product are as follows:

- Maturity benefit: 100% of the bid value of the units;

- Death benefit: 100% of the bid value of the units;

- Surrender benefit: 100% of the bid value of the units, less a surrender penalty;

- Charges: Annual fund management charge expressed as a percentage of the bid value of the units; and

- No medical underwriting. Over the past two years, the insurer has experienced a significant increase in surrenders on the Education Savings Plan product. The company is considering introducing the additional benefits listed below, which would be new in the market, in order to improve the persistency experience for the product:

- Partial surrender, whereby policyholders can withdraw up to 50% of the bid value of units in any given year while keeping the policy in-force;

- Alteration of premium, whereby policyholders will be able to increase or decrease premiums at any time during the term and by any amount; and

- Optional waiver of premium on total permanent disability or redundancy. Discuss the suitability of the additional benefits under the headings: a. Meeting customers' needs b. Marketability and competitiveness

c. Profitability
d. Risk characteristics

## QUESTION 8

Bharata is a developing country with a large population spread across a number of districts, each with a mix of rural and urban areas. The majority of the large low-income workforce belongs to either urban industrial cooperatives or rural agricultural cooperatives. Members of these cooperatives have traditionally had limited access to financial services.
Ten years ago, Bharata's government began to sponsor a National Insurance Scheme (NIS) that provides death cover for members of the urban cooperatives on a compulsory basis. The benefit amount is a fixed amount of $10 000 in local currency, which is in the region of twice the average annual income of the low-income population in the country.
Every year, Bharata's insurers are invited to tender to be the insurance provider in a specific district or districts. Insurers quote a premium rate per district, priced on a single rate per member basis, in their tender. The business is awarded, on a district-by-district basis, to the insurer with the lowest quoted premium for that district. The successful insurer for each district is then responsible for paying all the claims related to the scheme for that district in return for the premium, which is fully paid by the government.
From next year, the NIS will be extending its coverage to provide compulsory death cover to members of the rural cooperatives at the same level as the cover currently provided to members of the urban cooperatives.
Insurers licensed in the country have been invited to tender on the provision of insurance cover to the NIS for the following year. As usual, insurers are required to quote premiums per district on a single rate per member basis, irrespective of the age or sex of the member or type of cooperative.
A large insurer that has provided death cover for urban cooperatives under the NIS in the past, is planning to tender on the provision of insurance to the NIS in respect of all districts covered by the scheme.
i. Explain how the insurer would determine the assumptions for the mortality rates and expense
loadings to be used in the pricing basis to determine the premiums for the scheme in respect of the individual districts for the coming year. (An explanation of how to carry out experience investigations is not required.)

product.

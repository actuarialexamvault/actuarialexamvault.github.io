A life insurance company is designing a new regular premium unit-linked savings product which provides no risk benefits. The only charge on the product is a management charge of 1% per annum.
An actuarial student proposed a design for a penalty to apply when a policyholder requests a reduction in the term of the policy. The proposed penalty to be deducted from the unit fund is: 0.5% × n × (the fund value at the time of alteration) where n is the reduction in the outstanding term of the policy measured in years. For example, if the original term is reduced by 1.5 years, then the penalty is equal to 0.75% of the fund value at the time of alteration.
ii. Discuss briefly the suitability of the proposed alteration penalty.

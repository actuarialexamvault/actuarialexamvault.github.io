## QUESTION 4

i. Describe how a passive valuation approach differs from an active approach.
[2]

A life insurance company that sells conventional with-profit endowment assurances, on a singlepremium and recurring-premium basis, has been using a passive valuation approach and the net premium valuation method for calculating its reserves for both statutory and internal management purposes.
One of the directors remarks that "The net premium valuation method makes no allowance for future bonuses and is imprudent because it does not include future renewal expenses. Furthermore, the company's passive valuation approach uses outdated assumptions and values that distort the company's true financial position."
ii. Discuss the points that you would make in addressing the director's comments.
[6]

The board of directors has decided that an active valuation approach is to be used for future internal management purposes.

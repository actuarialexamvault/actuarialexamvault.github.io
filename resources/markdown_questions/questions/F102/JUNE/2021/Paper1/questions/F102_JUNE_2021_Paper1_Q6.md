## QUESTION 6

People's Life writes a large volume of credit life polices where the policyholders are clients of a large micro-finance institution, People's MFI that is part of the same financial services group. It is compulsory for the borrowers of People's MFI to purchase the credit life policy from People's Life when they take out a loan from People's MFI. The credit life policies pay the outstanding balance of the loan on the death of the policyholder.
People's MFI only issues low value (average loan value R15 000) and short-term (average term 9 months) loans. People's MFI is remunerated by People's Life through commission and service fees for new business administration, on-going policy servicing and administration of claims.
People's Life has decided to expand its product range by offering a 1-year term assurance policy with a sum assured of R15 000 to the low-income market sold through an in-bound call centre staffed by salaried agents. The product will not be underwritten and there will be no differentiation in premiums by age or sex.
i. Explain the differences in the pricing assumptions for the new product compared to those for
the product sold to the borrowers of People's MFI.

The low-income market has limited access to health care services. The insurer is considering adding a free annual health check-up as a benefit on the new product.
ii. Explain how the introduction of the health check-up benefit could impact the experience for the
new product.

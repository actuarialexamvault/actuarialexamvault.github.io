## QUESTION 8

A life insurance company has a large and mature book of 10-year without-profit term assurance policies that give the policyholder the option to double the sum assured at the 5th policy anniversary without providing further evidence of health.
The insurer has previously determined the cost of the option assuming that all policyholders take up the option and that mortality for the policyholders who take up the option follows the ultimate mortality rates from the standard industry mortality tables. For future sales, the insurer has decided to determine the cost of the option based on the expected take up rate and the expected mortality of policyholders taking up the option. The expected take up rate and expected mortality for those taking up the option will be based on the actual experience for this business over the last 5 years.
i. State possible reasons for a policyholder choosing to exercise the option.
[2]

ii. Explain how the investigation into the take up rates and mortality rates would be performed.
[4]

iii. Describe the different cashflows that are expected to arise over the policy term for this product.

The marketing manager has suggested that the insurer relaxes the restrictions on the option.
iv. State 2 restrictions in the current product relating to the option.
[1]

v. Explain the increased risks to the insurer if the restrictions on the option are relaxed.

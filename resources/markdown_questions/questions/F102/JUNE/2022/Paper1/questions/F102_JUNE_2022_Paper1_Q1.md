## QUESTION 1

i. Describe how you would use a cashflow projection model to perform the profit test exercise.

This option to extend the contract term will be offered at standard premium rates at the time of the extension, without underwriting at that time.
ii. Outline how you would use the cashflow model to determine the cost of the option.

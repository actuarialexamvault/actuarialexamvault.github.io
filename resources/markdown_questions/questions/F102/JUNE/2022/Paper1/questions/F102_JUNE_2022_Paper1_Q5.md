## QUESTION 5

i. State the principles that should be considered when designing the surrender value terms for
conventional life insurance products.
[5]

A life insurance company plans to introduce a new without-profits whole life assurance policy, with premiums that escalate at a fixed effective rate of 5% per annum, compound, and with benefits which remain unchanged.
It has been proposed that the surrender value for this policy should be equal to the prospective policy value on a realistic basis and that no surrender value should be paid if this policy value is negative.
ii. Discuss the suitability of this proposal.

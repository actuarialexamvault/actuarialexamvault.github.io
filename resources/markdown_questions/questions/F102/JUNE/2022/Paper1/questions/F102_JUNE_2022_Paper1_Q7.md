## QUESTION 7

The insurance regulator in a small developing country is revising the solvency regime. Under the current regime insurance liabilities are determined using a passive approach and the net premium valuation method. The new regime will require an active approach where insurance liabilities will be calculated using the gross premium valuation method on a market consistent basis.
i. Outline 2 advantages and 2 disadvantages of the new approach for calculating the insurance
liabilities.
[2]

Current regulatory minimum solvency requirements are based on percentages of insurance liabilities, with percentages varying by class of business. For purposes of demonstrating solvency, the market value of assets is reduced by specified discount factors, with discount factors varying by asset class.
ii. Outline the weaknesses of the current solvency approach compared to a "Value at Risk"
approach.
[4]

An insurer in the market has a small portfolio of 15-year without-profits term assurances. The insurer is calculating its insurance liabilities under the new regime for the first time.
iii. List the data and assumptions required for the valuation of these insurance liabilities on a
market-consistent basis and explain how the insurer would set the discount rate.

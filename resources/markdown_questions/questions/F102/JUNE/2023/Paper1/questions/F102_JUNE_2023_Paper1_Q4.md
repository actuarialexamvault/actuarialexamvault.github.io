## QUESTION 4

A life insurance company that sells without-profits term assurance contracts only is considering how to calculate the adjusted premium to charge policyholders who request a change in their smoking status classification. These are policyholders who were classified as smokers when they bought the policy but have now stopped smoking for an extended period of time. In terms of the company's new business underwriting practices, these lives would now be classified as non-smokers. The sums assured on their policies are to remain unchanged.
The company proposes calculating the new premium for an altered policy by equating prospective policy values. The original pricing basis will be used to calculate the policy value before alteration and the current pricing basis applicable to new business policies sold to non-smokers will be used to calculate the policy value after alteration.
Discuss the considerations that you would take into account in evaluating this proposal.

## QUESTION 6

An established life insurance company sells conventional with-profits endowment assurance policies where policyholders share only in the investment and mortality surplus with bonuses distributed using the "additions to benefits" method.

i. Discuss the key factors influencing the appropriate asset mix for these with-profits policies and
suggest appropriate assets.

The insurer is considering closing the book of with-profits endowment policies to new business.
ii. Discuss the factors that the company should consider when deciding upon the split between
reversionary and terminal bonuses for future bonus declarations on the closed book in both the short-term and long-term.

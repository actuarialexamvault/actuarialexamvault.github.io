## QUESTION 7

Continent Life writes an annually renewable term assurance product with very low sums assured in an African country. The product only covers the policyholder's life and policyholders must be aged between 18 and 70. Low- and middle-income earners are targeted with this product.

The product is sold solely through Continent Life's direct marketing team, and the insurance application is done entirely via the policyholder's mobile phone using a dedicated phone application ("app"). The company has not asked for policyholder information other than the name and date of birth at new business stage and has historically charged a single undifferentiated premium rate per unit of sum assured to all policyholders.
The product has been making mortality losses for several years and it has been proposed that age-rating is implemented for this product.
i. Discuss the main factors to consider in evaluating this proposal.
[8]

Assume that the proposal was adopted and that it is now three years after implementing the age-rating change. Continent Life is conducting a withdrawal experience analysis based on the last five years of data.
ii. List 4 factors by which data could be grouped for this analysis.
[2]

The results of the analysis show that lapse and withdrawal rates for this book as a whole, for the preceding year, were significantly higher than expected.
iii. Suggest some further analysis the company could carry out and outline briefly actions the
company may take to address the poor withdrawal experience identified.

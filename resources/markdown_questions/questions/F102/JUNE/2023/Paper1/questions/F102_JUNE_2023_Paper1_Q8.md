## QUESTION 8

Critical illness (CI) insurance in a particular country may only be offered through conventional products providing lump sum benefits. Almost all companies in the country provide cover for the 10 major CIs identified by the National Industry Body (NIB). From time to time the NIB will revise the list of illnesses included in the list of major CIs.
TopCI has written CI insurance in this country for many years. To distinguish itself from the other players in the CI market it intends to launch a new CI product as outlined below, to be sold through independent intermediaries:

- Initially policyholders will select only 5 of the 10 major CIs to include in their cover.

- Initial underwriting will be carried out in the same way as would have been done had all 10 CIs been covered.

- On stated dates, and without any further evidence of health having to be provided, policyholders will have the option to increase the number of CIs covered under their policy - up to the maximum number then recognized by the NIB.

- The initial premium rate for this policy will be significantly less than the premiums charged for the other CI products available in the market (as those generally cover all 10 of the major CIs).

- The premium rates to be charged in respect of any additional CIs added to the cover are not guaranteed.

i. Outline the additional morbidity risk TopCI would face if it offers the proposed CI product as
well as its current (standard) CI product.
[4]

ii. Outline briefly 6 reasons why the proposed product may produce disappointing levels of new
business take-up.
[3]

iii. Suggest 8 ways (other than reinsurance) in which TopCI could reduce the morbidity risk if it
decides to offer the proposed product (without changing the core product features outlined above), explaining how each suggestion will help reduce the risk.

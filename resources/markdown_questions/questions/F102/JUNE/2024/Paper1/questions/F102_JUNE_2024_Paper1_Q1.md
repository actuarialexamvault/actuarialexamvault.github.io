## QUESTION 1

You are an actuary at a small life insurer which specialises in health and care insurance products.
Currently your company only offers a stand-alone conventional critical illness product which covers the major critical illnesses and pays a once-off lump sum benefit upon claim.
Your company has decided to introduce a tiered benefit structure in place of its current single lump sum benefit structure.
i. Discuss how the product design and pricing requirements differ between the new and existing
products.
[5]

One of your colleagues has made the statement that this new tiered critical illness product should be cheaper than the existing non-tiered product.
ii. Comment briefly on the validity of this statement.
[2]

After selling the new product for a year, a pandemic hits the country in which the company operates, resulting in a nationwide lockdown for two months.
iii. Comment on the impact that this may have on the insurer's critical illness claims experience on
the tiered product, both during and after the lockdown.

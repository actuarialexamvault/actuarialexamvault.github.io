## QUESTION 1

A life insurance company is designing a new conventional without-profits whole life product. Premiums will be payable monthly in advance. The proposed surrender value for this product is:

- a prospective policy value on best estimate assumptions for any surrender thereafter.

i. Describe how the basis is likely to be determined for the calculation of the policy value.

ii. Explain how each of the following events, considered independently, is likely to affect the asset
share, the surrender value and hence the retained profit on a policy that surrenders: a. A sharp decrease in long-term interest rates; and b. The onset of a new incurable disease leading to an increase in mortality.

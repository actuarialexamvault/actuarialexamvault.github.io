## QUESTION 4

A life insurance company recently started offering conventional without-profits deferred annuities with a 10-year deferred period where the policyholder pays monthly premiums in arrears during the deferred period and receives a guaranteed monthly annuity thereafter until death.
Policyholders who are deemed to be in suitably poor health at the end of the deferred period, subject to confirmation by underwriting, will be granted an enhanced annuity. The amount by which this annuity will exceed their guaranteed standard annuity will depend on their state of health as assessed at the end of the deferred period. Enhancement terms will be guaranteed and specified on sale of the deferred annuity.
i. Outline the needs that the product meets for policyholders and for the company.
[5]

ii. Identify and outline the key risks faced by the company from offering the enhanced annuity as
well as how each of these risks can be managed.

## QUESTION 8

A recently established life insurance company intends to issue regular premium unit-linked individual income protection contracts, with the following structure:

- The risk benefit will be a fixed regular amount per policy determined at outset.

- There will be a premium waiver during a claim, with unit allocations and cancellations continuing.

- On death, surrender or at the end of the policy term, the policyholder will receive the bid value of the units (although this is not expected to be a significant amount).

- Units will be held in the company's conservative investment fund.

- Units will be cancelled regularly to meet the risk premiums. The office will retain the right to vary these charges to reflect experience.

- Office premiums will be reviewed on a 5-yearly basis.

compared with a conventional income protection product.

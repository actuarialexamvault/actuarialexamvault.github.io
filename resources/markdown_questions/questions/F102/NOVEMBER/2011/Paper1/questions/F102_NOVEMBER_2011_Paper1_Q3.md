## QUESTION 3

You work for a small life insurance company operating in a densely populated island region exposed to seismic risk. The insurer's without-profit conventional term assurance business is currently reinsured via both an original terms quota share arrangement and a catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance treaty.
i. Explain the general purpose of underwriting.
[1]

ii. Outline briefly the various types of underwriting, other than medical underwriting, which may
be carried out prior to the issue of a term assurance policy, explaining the specific purpose of each.
[5]

iii. List the potential sources of data that could have been used when setting the mortality
assumptions for pricing this portfolio of business, giving reasons why each might be used.
[3]

iv. Recent mortality experience has been poor and volatile on an annual basis. One of the
directors is concerned about the effect of the poor mortality experience on the solvency of the company.
She has made two suggestions:

- The insurer increases the percentage reinsured on the quota share.

- The catastrophe cover treaty is not renewed because of its high cost. Comment on the director's suggestions and discuss the approach that should be taken and issues that need to be considered in order for you to be able to evaluate the reinsurance programme for this book of business.

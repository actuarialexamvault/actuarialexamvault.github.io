## QUESTION 5

Your company has an established portfolio of single premium conventional endowment assurances.
The company is currently designing a recurring premium unit-linked endowment assurance product.
i. Outline briefly the considerations that you would take into account in setting the surrender
penalty on this product.
[7]

ii. Describe the profit test model that you would use to determine the charging structure of the
unit-linked product.
[6]

iii. After performing the profit testing, two acceptably profitable charging structures are proposed
for the new product: a. 40% of the premium is allocated to the unit fund in the first two years with an allocation percentage of more than 100% thereafter. Management fees are low at 0.5% p.a. The bid offer spread is 5%. b. 95% of the premium is allocated to two unit funds. In the first 2 years, the premium is allocated to a capital unit fund with a management charge of 4.75% p.a.
Thereafter, premiums are allocated to an accumulation unit fund with a management charge of 0.75% p.a. The bid offer spread is 5%.
The only other regular charge present is a charge for the risk benefit.
Discuss the considerations that should be taken into account when deciding which product design to use.

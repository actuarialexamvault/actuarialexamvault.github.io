## QUESTION 6

You work for a well-established insurance conglomerate operating in a sophisticated market. The conglomerate has two specialist subsidiary life companies, one specialising in savings and the other in risk products. Both product lines are recurring premium products, and are only sold via intermediaries. Commission is currently the same on both lines: an upfront commission with a prorata clawback on surrender within the first two years.
The regulator has recently changed the commission regulations for savings products so that commission is only paid as and when premiums are received at a fixed percentage of the premium.
There is no change to the commission structure on risk products.
Explain the likely impact of this change on the business of each specialist subsidiary insurer, with particular reference to the capital needs and the solvency position of each.

## QUESTION 1

The dominant life insurer in a small developing country sells mainly group life business to clothing manufacturers and construction companies. The standard group life cover provides a benefit of twice annual salary on death. Mortality assumptions used in determining the premiums for the group life cover are reviewed annually taking into account the experience of each insured scheme. The insurer is considering expanding the number of rating factors that it uses for group life premium rates.
i. Outline the likely automatic-acceptance criteria for the group life cover.

ii. List the sources of medical information that could be used to underwrite individuals with high
sums insured.
[2]

iii. Describe the process the pricing actuary would follow for reviewing the group life mortality
assumptions.

A mortality analysis reveals poor experience in the insurer's schemes for construction companies. The insurer is considering increasing the premium rates for these schemes. This would result in the rates being higher than those charged by its competitors.
iv. Outline briefly the risks to the insurer of increasing premium rates for construction companies
above those of its competitors.

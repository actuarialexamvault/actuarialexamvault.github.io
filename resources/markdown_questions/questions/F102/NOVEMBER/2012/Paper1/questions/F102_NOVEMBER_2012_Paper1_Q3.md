## QUESTION 3

You are the actuary of a specialist captive insurer (GHI) that was established by High Finance Bank (HFB) to provide instalment protection policies to individuals taking out home mortgages with HFB.
Borrowers are compelled to purchase instalment protection policies from GHI with the bank as beneficiary in order to cover mortgage repayments during periods of incapacity. Mortgages are repaid by monthly instalments of capital and interest, and are variable rate, i.e. repayments vary with interest rates. GHI's instalment protection policies are without-profits policies with guaranteed premium rates.
The instalment protection benefit at inception is equal to the initial level of the mortgage repayment.
The benefit level is revised annually to be in line with the then current mortgage repayment. The premium is also adjusted annually to reflect the revised benefit level. Incapacity is based on occupational definitions and there is no deferred period.
Your finance director notes that there has been a reduction in the return on capital of the product as a result of higher claims experience, and he suggests that the business should be reviewed. He suggests reviewing the rating factors and that a three-month deferred period be introduced, in line with common industry practice.
i. List, with explanations, the demographic factors that could impact on the claim inception
and/or termination rates.
[5]

ii. Outline briefly the purposes of a deferred period for instalment protection policies.
[2]

iii. Discuss the merits of the director's suggestion to introduce a deferred period.
[3]

iv. Suggest other changes that GHI could consider to improve the return on capital of the
product, outlining briefly the potential risk to GHI of each proposal.

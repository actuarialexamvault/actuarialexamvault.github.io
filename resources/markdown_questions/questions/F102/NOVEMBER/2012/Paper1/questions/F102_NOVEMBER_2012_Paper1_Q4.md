## QUESTION 4

The Chief Actuary of People's Life Insurer has commissioned a review of the surrender terms of its individual regular premium without-profits endowment assurance policies. This product is sold to government employees and cover is terminated if the policyholder moves to the private sector.
Surrender values are calculated using asset shares at early durations and a prospective policy value thereafter. The use of asset shares results in low surrender values at early durations, compared to premiums paid.
i. Describe, without the use of formulae or diagrams, the prospective value methodology and
how suitable assumptions might be determined for surrender values.
[7]

ii. Outline the risks to the insurer of continuing to use the current methodology for determining
surrender values.

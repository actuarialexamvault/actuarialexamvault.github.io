## QUESTION 5

A life insurer has a large book of 15-year annual premium unit-linked endowment assurance policies.
Commission to sales agents is 50% of each of the first two premium payments. Furthermore, 95% of each premium is allocated to the unit fund and there is a fixed annual management charge of 5% on this unit fund.
The benefits under the policy are structured as follows: Death: maximum of the bid value of the units or 100% of premiums paid Maturity: maximum of the bid value of the units or 110% of the premiums paid Surrender: bid value of the units less a surrender penalty (the surrender penalty starts at 15% of the value of the unit fund and reduces over the term of the policy) A change in the regulatory environment has led to higher levels of required capital for insurers and pressures on this insurer's solvency position.

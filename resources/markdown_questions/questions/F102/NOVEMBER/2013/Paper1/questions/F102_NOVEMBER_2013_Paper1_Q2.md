## QUESTION 2

A large charitable trust manages a number of retirement communities across a particular country. Two types of living arrangements are provided at each of these communities:

- Independent Accommodation; and

- Frail Care: Full-time nursing and personal care in specialised accommodation at the retirement community. It is common for retired persons to move into Independent Accommodation initially and then move to Frail Care, the much more expensive option, if and when their level of incapacity necessitates fulltime care. The charitable trust has approached several large insurers to design a long-term care product to be sold to members of the retirement communities. The two product structures being considered are as follows:

- Option A: A pre-determined monthly cash benefit payable from when the policyholder first enters Frail Care. The benefit increases by 6% per annum and is payable for the remainder of the life-time of the policyholder.

- Option B: A cost of care benefit paying the additional costs of the Frail Care arrangement (over and above the cost of the Independent Accommodation) until the death of the policyholder. The maximum monthly frail care benefit at any time is capped at 2.5 times the initial additional monthly cost of Frail Care at claims inception.

i. Suggest claims definitions for this product and outline briefly the key considerations when
determining such claims definitions.

ii. Outline the relative advantages and disadvantages for the policyholder of each benefit option.

iii. Describe the general business environment factors that should be considered by a life

## QUESTION 3

A life insurance company writes only conventional protection business. You have recently been made responsible for reinsurance arrangements at the company. Your predecessor was very risk averse and set up a risk premium reinsurance arrangement on a 95% quota share basis for all products. The insurance portfolio has grown substantially since the quota share arrangement was put in place. The managing director has asked you to undertake a review of the company's reinsurance arrangements.
i. Suggest reasons why, when it was originally negotiated, it may have been beneficial to the
insurer to set up the current reinsurance arrangement.
[2]

ii. Highlight key disadvantages of the current reinsurance arrangement.
[1]

The company has decided to move away from quota share reinsurance and establish a new reinsurance programme.
iii. Describe possible types of reinsurance that could be used in the new reinsurance programme
and outline the key factors that will influence the reinsurance programme negotiated.

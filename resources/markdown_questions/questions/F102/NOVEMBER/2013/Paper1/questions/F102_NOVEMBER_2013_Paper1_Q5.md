## QUESTION 5

You are the pricing actuary for a large, well-established South African life insurance company. For many years the insurer has focused on whole life assurances, immediate annuities and unit-linked investment products for the middle and higher income markets.
The existing whole life product has a minimum sum assured of R200 000 and no maximum sum assured limit. The average sum insured for the business sold is R800 000. Extensive underwriting is applied for this product. Each applicant is required to complete a detailed application form, which contains medical questions. Applications are flagged for additional medical tests based on the answers to the medical questions and the size of the sum assured. The underwriting information is used to determine whether lives are accepted at standard rates, loaded, declined, or specific exclusions are applied. Pricing for this product makes use of rating factors common in the market.
The company is launching a regular premium simple whole life assurance product with limited underwriting and with no surrender value. The minimum sum insured will be R50 000 and the maximum R300 000. This product will be sold via the same distribution channel as the existing product.
i. Suggest, with reasons, an appropriate approach to the underwriting of the new simple whole
life product.

ii. Identify the assumptions needed to price the new product, and describe how you would set
each assumption.

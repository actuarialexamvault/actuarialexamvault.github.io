## QUESTION 7

A life insurance company is designing a new 10-year regular premium unit-linked savings product.
Policyholders can select from a number of equities-based funds. On maturity the policyholder will receive the maximum of the bid value of the units or a return of premiums. The only charge on the product will be a 2% p.a. fund management charge.
i. Explain how a stochastic model could be used to model the cost of the maturity guarantee.

An actuarial student has proposed that the following penalties (to be deducted from the unit fund) should be applied if the policy is altered by the policyholder: Alteration Penalty Premium reduction (10% of the chosen percentage reduction in premium) × bid value of units (For example, if premiums are reduced by 40% then the surrender penalty will be 4% of the bid value of the units) Alteration or partial 10% × bid value of units being disinvested disinvestment

## QUESTION 1

Omega Life is a niche insurer, focusing on micro-credit life insurance products.
The insurer has recently entered into an agreement with a bank targeting the middle- and upperincome market segments, to provide a 20-year term assurance product for mortgage loan customers.

The bank wishes to offer two versions of this product:

- A standard 20-year level term assurance.

- A renewable 20-year level term assurance, where the policyholder has the option to renew the cover at standard premium rates for a further 10 years at the end of the original policy term. No additional underwriting will be required at the time of policy renewal.

i. Define the cost of a mortality option and outline briefly the factors that would influence the
cost of the renewal option.
[4]

ii. Describe briefly two methods that can be used to price mortality options.
[3]

The insurance company expects a wide range of sums assured for the new product, with a significant increase in the maximum sum assured compared to its current products. The insurer is concerned about the variability in individual claim sizes that may arise from this product.
iii. Describe briefly a reinsurance arrangement that may be appropriate for the product, which
would address the insurer's concerns.

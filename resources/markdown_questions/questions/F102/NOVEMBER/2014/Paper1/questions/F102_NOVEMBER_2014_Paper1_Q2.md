## QUESTION 2

You are the actuary of a local insurer that specialises in stand-alone pre-funded long-term care products. The products are designed as without-profit single-premium products and provide a monthly income once the insured meets the requirements for long-term care. The level of monthly benefit is based on a regulated scale of monetary amounts that varies by degree of impairment. This scale is reviewed and updated annually by the insurance regulator, and has historically increased by CPI. The benefits are guaranteed to be paid as long as they are needed. There is no death or surrender benefit.
The investment strategy for this product has not been based on any modelling exercise, and has instead been based on general features of the liabilities.
i. Describe the key features of the liabilities that should have a bearing on the investment
strategy for this insurer.
[5]

ii. State, with reasons, the likely assets to have been selected by the insurer to match the
liabilities.
[4]

You decide to build a model to help set the investment strategy for this insurer.
iii. Outline briefly the model required for this purpose, and explain how the model can be used to
help set the investment strategy for this insurer.

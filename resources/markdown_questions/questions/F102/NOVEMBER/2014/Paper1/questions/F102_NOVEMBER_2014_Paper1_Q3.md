## QUESTION 3

You are the product design actuary for a life office with a good range of disability products. The life office considering the introduction of a new unitised accumulating with-profit product with level annual premiums are payable in advance. The product is only available to individuals aged 50 and younger at inception and each policy will mature on the policyholder's 65th birthday.
The benefits are as follows:

- On surrender: the bid value of the units less a surrender penalty.

- On death or maturity: the bid value of the units.

- If the policyholder is classified as permanently disabled during the product term: an immediate annuity payable until age 65 or earlier death. The annuity will be purchased with the bid value of the units and the insurance company's disability annuity rates at that time will be applied. The annual annuity will be subject to a guaranteed minimum of 5 times the policy's annual premium. The charges on the contract are a bid-offer spread of 5% and an annual fund management charge of 3% per annum. The company's standard disability underwriting rules will apply.

i. Discuss the factors that will affect the marketability of this product.
[10]

You are also considering offering a unit-linked version of this product where, instead of an accumulating with-profit design, the policyholder will have a choice of investment funds.
ii. Compare and contrast the features of an accumulating with-profit design and a unit-linked
design, as alternatives for this product.

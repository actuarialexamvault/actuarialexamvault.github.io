## QUESTION 5

A life insurance company currently sells a regular (monthly) premium unit-linked endowment assurance product through independent intermediaries. Recently there has been an increase in withdrawals and a decline in new business volumes for this product. It has been suggested that the product is not competitive compared to other products in the market.
The current features of the product are as follows:

- Death benefit: 100% of the bid value of units

- Surrender value: 100% of the bid value of units

- Initial commission: 75% of the first year's premiums

- Term: 15 years

- Investment funds: Choice of low risk, medium risk or high risk investment funds

- Initial underwriting: No medical underwriting

- Charges: 25% of each premium for the first year; 2.5% of premiums for each subsequent year; and a monthly charge on the unit fund The following changes have been proposed in order to improve the competitiveness of the product:

- Increase the death benefit to 150% of the value of the units and adjust the allowance for mortality in the charging structure, using the same mortality rates as for the existing product structure.

- Revise the charging structure to be 2.5% of premiums for the whole policy term and increase the monthly charge on the unit fund.

- Outsource the on-going administration of the policies to a unit fund administrator and revise the assumptions for future renewal expenses in the charging structure to allow for the expected cost savings.

i. Describe the new or increased risks to the insurer associated with the proposed changes.
[11]

ii. Suggest how the insurer could manage the risks identified in part (i).
[7]

The insurer is drafting a policy document describing the process of the calculation of the unit fund prices to be used by the unit fund administrator.
iii. State the equity principle that should be applied to the pricing of an internal unit-linked fund
and describe the process for calculating the appropriation prices for the fund.

## QUESTION 6

A small life office writes group life and low sum assured individual whole of life policies.
The group life product is sold to employers to provide death and disability benefits to their workforce.
The cover provides a death benefit of one times the employee's annual salary and a disability benefit of 75% of an employee's monthly salary until the first of retirement, recovery or death. Cover is provided for a 12-month period and may be renewed. On renewal, premiums are reviewed.
The individual whole of life policies are sold through tied agents. Remuneration to agents is 10 months of premium on the successful sale of a policy (for each policy sold). The whole of life policy offers life cover of R50 000, payable on death only.
The local insurance supervisor has historically required prospective policyholder liabilities to be valued using a prudent gross premium valuation method.
You are the actuary responsible for determining the policyholder liabilities for the insurer.
i. Describe how you would determine the provision for:
a. the claims incurred but not settled before the year end for the group life product, and b. the prospective policyholder liabilities for the individual whole of life product.
[6]

The insurance supervisor has recently revised the regulations relating to the valuation of policyholder liabilities, by replacing the requirement for a prudent valuation basis with a best-estimate basis.
ii. Describe the timing of expected profit over the term of the whole of life policies, for existing
business and for new business following the change in regulations.
[3]

iii. Given the new best-estimate liability regime, suggest how the regulator could maintain the
same level of confidence that insurers would remain in a financially sound position in the event of worse than expected experience.

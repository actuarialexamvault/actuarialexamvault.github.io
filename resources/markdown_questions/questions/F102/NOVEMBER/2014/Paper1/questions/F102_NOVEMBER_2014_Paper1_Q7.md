## QUESTION 7

A large life insurance company sells individual regular premium without-profit income protection products through independent intermediaries. These products are established in the market.
The tax authorities in the country are implementing a change in the method of taxing income protection policies. The existing structure is that premiums are paid from pre-tax income (that is, there is tax relief on the premiums), and benefits are taxed as income in the hands of the beneficiary, at the appropriate income tax rates. From the start of the next calendar year, the premiums must be paid from post-tax income, and benefits will be paid tax free. The change will apply for all current and future policies and claimants.
i. Outline the underwriting and claims assessment and management processes for without-profit
income protection policies.

ii. Explain the possible reasons for the tax change, from the perspective of the tax authority.

above.

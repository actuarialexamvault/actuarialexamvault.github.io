## QUESTION 1

(i)
The cost of an option is the value of the excess of the premium that should, in the light of full
underwriting information, have been charged for the additional assurance over the normal
premium rate that is charged.
The additional cost of an option depends on the health status of those who choose to exercise
the option. There is a significant risk of anti-selection with mortality options, which is linked
to the proportion of policyholders who choose to exercise the option.
For renewal of the contract it is expected that policyholders who take up the option will have
higher mortality than the expected mortality experience for the original term assurance
contract. The anti-selection effect is exacerbated if a low proportion of policyholders exercise
the option.
The following factors will influence the cost of the option:
 Conditions attaching to exercising the option, such as limiting the sum assured to not
more than the sum assured of the original contract.
 The encouragement given to policyholders to exercise the option increases the take-
up of the option, but this could increase the take-up by high mortality risk lives.
 The default option, i.e. whether the default position is opt in or opt out, which could
affect the take up rate.
 The extra cost of the option (charged to policyholders during the original policy
term). Relatively high additional premiums could lead to selective withdrawals if
healthy lives lapse to get cheaper cover without the option.
 The amount of underwriting underlying new business rates at the renewal date, as this
affects the gap between the select and ultimate mortality experience.
The cost of the option could be offset to some extent by the loadings for initial expenses and
underwriting that are contained in the new business premiums, but only to the extent that
these are not required to cover administration costs of making the renewal.
The original product is provides credit cover for mortgages so after 20 years policyholders
might have very little need for this product and any renewals might thus be for individuals
that are in poor health.

Including the option increases the premium on the original product, so the product with the
option will mostly be bought by individuals that expect to benefit from the option, which
increases the cost of the option.
(ii)
There are two methods for valuing mortality guarantees:
The conventional method, which assumes:
 All policyholders take up the option.
 Policyholders taking up the option experience ultimate mortality rates.
The North American method, which assumes:
 A double decrement table is used to model the proportion of policyholders taking
up the option.
 After the option date a separate mortality table is applied for policyholders that
take up the option.
(iii)
Individual surplus reinsurance (or individual excess of loss) can be used to help reduce the
variance of the insurer’s expected mortality experience. This will manage the insurer’s
concerns over the wide variance and increase in sum assured for these products.
For individual surplus the amount reinsured is the excess of the sum assured over the insurer’s
retention limit on an individual life.
This can be done using either original terms or a risk premium method.
The reinsurance will usually be negotiated on a treaty basis because this enables immediate
acceptance to be given without needing to refer the risk to the insurer first.
Examiner comments
This was a relatively easy question that was fairly well answered. However, based on the
amount written by candidates it seems that candidates spent too much time on this question,
writing down many points that did not score any marks. This was especially the case for part
(ii) where many candidates detailed the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods,
instead of just briefly describing the methods.
Many candidates did not take the details of this question into account for part (i). For
example, many candidates mentioned that a longer policy term or multiple option take up
dates will affect the option take up rate, while the question clearly fixed the policy term at 20
years and the specified that there is only a single option take up date.
A number of candidates included the cost of administering the option take up in the definition
of the option, but this did not score any marks, as the notes explicitly define the cost of a
mortality option as given above.
Some candidates went into a great amount of detail about the factors affecting the take up
rate, while the answer should have covered both the option take up rate and the mortality
rates of those taking up the option. Very few marks were available for the factors affecting the
take up rate.
Part (ii) was a very easy bookwork question.
Part (iii) was generally well answered, although some candidates did not answer the
question, as they stated that aggregate reinsurance agreements (stop loss or catastrophe
cover) would reduce volatility in claim sizes. These arrangements would reduce volatility of
total claims, not of individual claim sizes. Some candidates mentioned many different

approaches to reduce claim volatility. In such cases marks were awarded only for the first
option, as candidates were asked to discuss a single reinsurance arrangement.

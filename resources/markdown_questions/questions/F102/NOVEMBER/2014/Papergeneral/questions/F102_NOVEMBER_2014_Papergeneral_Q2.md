## QUESTION 2

(i)
Key features of the liabilities:
 Nature of liabilities: both the out-of-payment and in-payment benefit levels increase
by CPI. The nature of the benefit is thus real. Life office expenses are likely to be
mainly staff-related, so are linked to wage inflation.
 Term of liabilities: this will depend on the average age of policyholders. As this
product is aimed at pre-funding (rather than immediate needs) long-term care
benefits, new business could come from pre-retirement individuals. However at
retirement individuals are more likely to have the funds and perceive the need for
such a benefit. Access to nursing and medical care is likely to contribute to survival to
high ages, making the term of liabilities at least 10 years, but likely much longer than
this.
 Currency: As this is a local insurer, benefits, expenses and premiums are all likely to
be in local currency terms.
 Level of uncertainty: this is greater than for traditional life or annuity products. There
will be greater uncertainty about the date of the benefit payment trigger, which will
be based on the degree of impairment and need for long-term care. There will be
uncertainty about the level of the initial benefit payment which is determined by the
regulator, and there will be uncertainty about future increases in benefit which are
based on both degree of impairment (which is likely to deteriorate over time) and
regulator increases. Further uncertainty is created by medical advances, which could
affect both the rate at which impaired lives deteriorate and the period for which
impaired lives survive.
 Size of portfolio: this could influence the risk of any mismatch between assets and
liabilities.
(ii)
The need to match the CPI-linked liability will lead to the need to hold assets that can achieve
that return. Guaranteed CPI-linked bonds will be the asset class of choice. However, these
assets might not be available, or in sufficient quantities, or at an acceptable price.
Equities and properties could also have been selected for this purpose. The return is not
guaranteed to match CPI inflation, but historically it has exceeded CPI over long periods.
However short term returns on these assets are volatile. The conventional without-profit
nature of the benefit design is such that the investment risk is borne by the insurer. The extent
to which the insurer can tolerate asset volatility depends primarily on its solvency/free asset
position. The greater the solvency level relative to the minimum requirements, the greater the
ability to absorb asset price volatility.
Property investments are made less attractive due to the presence of liquidity risk on this
business.
Asset volatility (in particular of equities) and benefit uncertainty will require diversification
within these asset classes and between asset classes. Conventional bonds might be selected for
this purpose, but the expected return on the latter is not real.

Some cash will be needed to meet the actual benefit payments and possibly for
diversification, however the expected returns will be lowest of all asset classes.
(iii)
The model will need to project the cashflows of the assets and liabilities over a defined
period. Projected asset, liability and solvency level values can be derived from the projected
cashflows.
Depending on the computer power available and size of the in-force book, model points may
need to be selected to represent the in-force policyholders.
New business model points may also be required, depending on whether new business should
be considered in deriving the investment strategy.
Assumptions need to be made for the economic and demographic variables based on best
estimate future expectations.
A decision is needed on which variables need to be modelled stochastically, and which can be
modelled deterministically. Assumptions need to have sensible joint behaviour.
A starting investment strategy will be tested by performing a large number of projections and
deriving a distribution of the solvency level at the end of the projection period. This will be
achieved through a combination of stochastic simulations and deterministic sensitivity tests.
Alternative investment strategies will also be tested.
The optimal investment strategy will be the one that meets the insurer’s risk-return
preference.
Examiners comments:
It is a big concern that candidates at this level do not understand that the combined portfolio
of all policies should be considered when looking at the liability profile and setting an
investment policy. The product in the question was not a living annuity type where each
person’s assets should be invested on an individual basis. It was a risk policy managed on a
pooled basis.
In part (i) the better candidates discussed the liability profile and took into account that there
was a deferred period before a claim and that the benefits increased during this deferred
period as well.
In part (ii), the better candidates started with the assets selected by the insurer, as asked in
the question. Weaker answers waffled about the issues to consider without actually
suggesting appropriate asset classes for the insurer.
In part (iii), the better candidates applied the cashflow modelling theory to pre-funded long-
term care products.

## QUESTION 5

(i)
Expenses and charging structure
The change to level monthly charges increases the mismatch between the amount and timing
of charges and the actual expenses of the insurer. Charges increase over time as the fund
value increases and the expenses (including upfront commission) being incurred are largely at
the start of the policy.
The appropriate level of the charges would need to be determined by modelling the charges
and expected expenses of the insurer. The generated charges will depend on new business
volumes, withdrawals, mortality, investment returns and premium size. There is a risk that an
inappropriate model and/ or incorrect assumptions are chosen so that charges are insufficient
for the actual expenses.
There is also a risk that the proposal to outsource expenses and predicted efficiency gains do
not happen and actual expenses are higher than expected.
Exposure to higher than expected expense inflation may be reduced due to the possibility of
higher investment returns (and thus higher fund management charges) in higher inflationary
environments, as then charges will also be higher.
Investment risk
There is a shift to a greater reliance on the monthly fund management charge to recover initial
expenses. These charges will be reduced if investment performance is lower than expected.
This is largely outside of the insurers control since the policyholder has a choice of
investment funds.
Mortality risk
Death strain at risk has increased to 50% of the value of the units.
Higher than expected mortality is particularly a risk at early stages since the charges for initial
expenses will be recovered over the term of the policy.
Increasing the death benefit with no underwriting or change in the mortality rates exposes the
insurer to anti-selection.
The company may also face a to a change in the mortality profile of the policyholders
attracted to the revised product, which may mean that past mortality experience may become
less relevant for predicting future experience (in which case the company is exposed to
greater assumptions risk).

Withdrawals
The change in the charging structure will result in higher amounts in the unit fund and
therefore higher surrender values at early durations, which may change the withdrawal
experience of the insurer. The insurer’s exposure to withdrawal risk at the early stages of the
policy, where the asset share is negative, is therefore increased.
Volume of new business and competition
The impact of these changes on business volumes may be different to that projected. If
business volumes are lower than expected charges may be insufficient to recover initial
expenses and the unit-linked endowment portfolio may fail to support the share of the
overheads of the insurer allocated to this business. If business volumes are higher than
expected, the financing requirements to support the initial costs and reserving requirements
for the business may result in pressure on the solvency position of the insurer and
administration processes and systems may be strained, leading to delays or errors in
processing and policyholder dissatisfaction.
There is a risk that a competitor may introduce an even more attractive product or
undercharge the premiums to gain market share and hence volumes sold may be significantly
less than predicted.
Action of distributors
Intermediaries may take advantage of no underwriting and lower initial premium allocation
charges and advise clients to select against the insurer.
The company might have a mis-selling risk and subsequent reputational risk, if charges and
benefits for the new product are not fully explained to policyholders.
Outsourcing and administration risk
There is a risk of poor service from the outsourced administration service provider resulting in
policyholder dissatisfaction and lower business volumes.
It may be challenging to integrate the existing systems of the insurer with the administration
service provider.
There is also counterparty default risk associated with the outsourced administration, if the
administrator can no longer provide the required administration services then:
 the insurer would incur once off costs to either take administration in house again
or to find another administration provider
 this might result in higher long-term administration costs if the administration
cannot be performed at the same levels
Legislative, regulatory or tax changes
Future legislative, regulatory or tax changes (e.g. maximum charges) may undermine the
profitability of the product.
(ii)
Expenses and charges
Change commission structure to ‘as and when’ or introduce commission claw-back on
withdrawal to reduce initial costs and better match charges to expenses. But this may be
unpopular with sales advisors if this is not market practice and there may be lower sales.
Introduce reviewable charges so that charges can be increased if experience is worse than
expected. But, but the implementation of changes to charges is likely to be limited in
practice.
Depending on the level of the revised charges it may be possible to consider introducing
actuarial funding (if fund management charges are high enough), or negative non-unit

reserves to mitigate the mismatch of initial expenses and charges. But this will depend on the
extent to which this is allowed by regulations.
Investment
Limit investor choice of funds to produce a more predictable level of charges. But this may be
unpopular with policyholders who may value investment choice.
Mortality risk
The insurer could introduce underwriting or a waiting period during which benefits will only
be paid for accidental deaths to reduce mortality risk.
The insurer could purchase reinsurance, but this may be costly given the lack of underwriting.
Withdrawal risk
Change surrender penalty to discourage early surrenders.
Change the sales process to reduce sale of the policies that are unaffordable or inappropriate
(e.g. affordability assessment or clear explanation of the terms and conditions of the policy).
Outsourcing risk
Conduct a thorough due diligence of the service provider and set up a watertight service level
agreement with penalties and a cancellation clause for non-performance of the service
provider.
Volume of business
Carry out thorough research into the demand for the product and to similar products in the
market.
Actions of distributors
Changing the mortality rates and changing surrender penalties will also contribute towards
removing the risk of distributors taking advantage of the insurer.
Train financial advisors on the new product to avoid inaccuracies in disclosures on the
product features.
(iii)
The equity principle for the internal unit fund states that the interests of unit-holders not
involved in a unit transaction should be unaffected by that transaction.
Calculation of the appropriation price (creation of units):
Determine the net asset value of the fund on an “offer basis”:
 market “offer price” value of the assets held by the fund
 plus the expenses (including stamp duty on purchase) that would be incurred in
the purchase of these assets
 plus the value of any current assets (e.g. cash on deposit)
 less the value of any current liabilities (e.g. investments purchased but not yet
settled)
 plus any accrued income, (e.g. interest income from fixed-interest securities and
deposits, net of any outgo, such as fund charges)
 less any allowance for accrued tax (if applicable)
Divide by the number of units existing at the valuation date (before any units are created/
cancelled)
Examiners’ comments
This was a long question with quite a lot of detail about the issues facing the insurer in the
question. Candidates were expected to use the information in the question to focus their ideas
for the solution.

For part (i) candidates who managed to identify a wide range of new and increased risks
scored well. A number of candidates discussed existing risks to the insurer rather than
focusing on new or increased risks. Many candidates failed to identify important risks to the
insurer and to consider a wide range of risks. Candidates who discussed one or two risks in
detail did not score well. The risks relating to charges and expenses were generally not
discussed in sufficient detail. This issue is important for a unit-linked product.
For part (ii) candidates who identified the key risks part (i) and then discussed mitigation
techniques for each risk identified tended to score better. General discussion and vague
points (e.g. pricing and checking assumptions) did not score marks. Few candidates
considered the implications of their suggestions, making suggestions to mitigate risks that
were unlikely to help the insurer achieve its goals (like increasing margins which is likely to
make the product less competitive).
Part (iii) was bookwork and generally well answered. But some candidates wasted time by
giving too many points on appropriation pricing for the number of marks allocated.

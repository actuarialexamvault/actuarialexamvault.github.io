## QUESTION 6

straight forward book work. In addition candidates made too few points for the mark
allocation; it seems as if candidates assumed to get a full mark for one concept, where it was
only half a mark.
In parts (i) and (ii) most candidates failed to score marks because they did not explicitly use
the terms IBNRs and outstanding claims. Several answers were too vague, touching on the
right concepts but giving to little detail to score marks.
Overall, most candidates realised that a best-estimate valuation will accelerate profits for
part (iii). But, only the strong candidates realised that no profit is expected in future and that
the source will be experience profit only.

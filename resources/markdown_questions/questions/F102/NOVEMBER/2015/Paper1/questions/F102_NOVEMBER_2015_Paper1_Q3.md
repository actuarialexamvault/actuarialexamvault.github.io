Summit Life sells a single premium retirement income product designed to be purchased by individuals at retirement. The premium less commission and initial fees is used to purchase units in an investment fund at policy inception. Annuity payments and management charges are deducted from the fund on a monthly basis. The annuity payments are expressed as an agreed percentage, determined at the outset, of the fund value at the time of payment of the annuity. After 10 years the bid value of the units in the fund is converted to a level monthly annuity, at the insurer's annuity rates at that time.
The bid value of units is also payable as a lump sum on death or surrender within the first 10 years of the policy.
The insurer is considering adding a guarantee to new policies. The guarantee would provide a minimum annuity payment for the level annuity equal to the average monthly amount paid from the fund in the three years prior to conversion to a level annuity. Policyholders selecting this guarantee will be restricted to investment in a single unit-fund. The guarantee will be charged for by adding a guarantee fee into the initial fees charged at the inception of the policy.
iii. Outline the benefits to the policyholder of the addition of this guarantee and the risks that
remain with the policyholder, in relation to both the unit-linked savings income and the level annuity component of the product.

iv. Describe how a cashflow model could be used to estimate the cost of the guarantee.

## QUESTION 5

Community Bank is a large bank providing banking services to the low-income market. The bank has recently established a subsidiary licensed to write life insurance business. Initially, the only product to be sold by this subsidiary is a low sum assured whole life insurance product with monthly premiums.
Policies are sold through sales agents in the country-wide network of bank branches. Sales agents are remunerated through initial commission on the basis of nine months of premiums on the sale of a policy, without clawback on lapses. There are no surrender benefits and premiums are guaranteed for the duration of the contract. The insurer has added the following differentiating product features:

- Loyalty benefit: Policyholders receive a cash benefit of one year's premium if their premiums are up to date at the fifth policy anniversary.

- Premium skip: Policyholders may miss two premium payments, but the policy will lapse if the missed and current premiums are not paid at the next premium payment date. The supervisory authority requires annual valuations of the policyholder liabilities using a gross premium valuation approach.

i. Describe the gross premium valuation method for determining the policyholder liabilities for
this product.
[4]

ii. List the checks on the data and outputs of the valuation of the policyholder liabilities that
would generally be performed to validate the results.
[5]

The product is initially priced using lapse assumptions for products with standard features in the market. After six years a lapse experience investigation is conducted, which shows that actual lapses have been much lower than the assumption used in the valuation of policyholder liabilities. It is expected that lapse rates will continue at this lower level for the foreseeable future and the insurer decides to reduce its best estimate assumption for lapse rates for the calculation of the policyholder liabilities.
iii. Explain the expected effect on the value placed on policyholder liabilities as a result of this
change in the valuation assumptions.
[3]

The better-than-expected lapse experience has motivated the insurer to take further actions to try to reduce its lapse experience.
iv. Outline actions that the insurer could take to reduce its lapse risk and improve lapse
experience.

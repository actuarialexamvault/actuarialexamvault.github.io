You are the Statutory Actuary for a large, well-established life insurance company. The company's executive remuneration scheme is currently based on its after-tax profits for the year, which are compared against the company's after-tax profits for the previous year.

You have proposed that this might be achieved by the use of Embedded Value profit methodology.

result in the interests of management and shareholders being better aligned.

## QUESTION 2

i.
Policyholder needs met by the product:
 Income protection (IP) benefits replace part of the income that the insured life would
have earned if he/she becomes unable to work (in his/her own occupation or possibly
any other) due to accident or illness.
 This benefit can be used to maintain the standard of living of the insured life on
disability as the state sickness benefits are usually insufficient.
 The benefit may be used to meet monthly loan servicing costs e.g. mortgage
repayments.
 IP benefit may be used to cover premiums on other insurance policies.
 Professional practices (lawyers, doctors) may use IP (Locum Protection) to protect
the partnership by replacing the income lost due to incapacity of one of the partners.
ii.
Product-related factors:
 Premiums may be uncompetitive.
 Benefit escalation might not be sufficient (out-of-claim and/or in-claim) leading to an
inadequate replacement ratio at claim stage or inadequate income after inception.
 Disability definitions might not be appropriate for the target market.
 Waiting and deferred periods might be too long compared to competitors.
 Linked-claims period might be too short.
 If there is no waiver of premium while incapacitated it might be seen as unattractive.
 Policyholders may value rehabilitation benefits, if this product does not provide these
benefits it might be less attractive than products that provide these benefits.

 The product maybe expensive relative to other products due to premium guarantees, a
lack of product features that would act as incentives to get policyholders to return to
work etc.
 Product structure may be undesirable e.g. policyholders may prefer a unit-linked
benefit with a savings component to a non-profit IP product.
 Product might be too complex.
Other factors:
 Insufficient commission to incentivise brokers and agents to sell a complex product.
 Ineffective sales channels (e.g. due to poor training, poor support).
 Poor marketing of the product, or targeting the wrong markets.
 Poor servicing and (probably related) poor brand image.
 Recession leading to poor sales for most products.
iii.
The insurer would be exposed to the anti-selection risk (the insurer will accept more sub-
standard lives at standard rates), particularly if benefits limits for medical examination referral
are for competitors lower than the new proposed medical limits.
In addition brokers may take advantage of lower underwriting limits to encourage
policyholders to take out policies with higher benefit limits.
Reliance on disclosures by the policyholder increases the risk that claims are repudiated on
the basis of non-disclosure of relevant information at the proposal stage, this may have a
negative impact on the reputation of the insurer.
Underwriting systems/software and manuals will need to be updated and underwriting staff
will need to be trained to use the proposal information and lifestyle disclosures alone to
underwrite higher benefit level policies.
There will be more variation in morbidity experience than expected in the pricing of product.
Cost of obtaining reinsurance may increase, as reinsurance terms may depend on the more
onerous existing underwriting practices.
iv.
Advantages:
 There is considerable uncertainty in estimating future disability claims experience in
the long term (which is dependent on changing risks and trends) hence considerable
risk in offering long-term guarantees.
 Risk based capital requirements (and cost of capital) will be lower due to lower
guarantees.
 The lower guarantees (and hence less need for margins and higher capital
requirements) should lead to more competitive premium rates.
Disadvantages:
 Premium increases will not be well received by policyholders, and some
policyholders may not have understood that this was a possibility, resulting in brand
damage for the insurer.
 Some policyholders may cancel their policies (higher surrender experience), and in
particular those in better health (selective withdrawals) leading to a worse risk pool.
 Due to competition and marketing pressure, the insurer may decide not to increase
premiums, which could be problematic.

Examiners’ comments
Part (i) was mainly bookwork, but many students failed to discuss the financial needs that an
income protection product could meet (e.g. locum protection for professional practices).
A good understanding of the product features was required for part (ii). Weaker candidates
failed to discuss a sufficient range common features for an income product in their solutions.
For part (iii) weaker candidates failed to discuss the implication of the change in the
underwriting practice. Few candidates considered the need to change underwriting
processes.
For part (iv) most candidates were able to identify the key advantages and disadvantages
relating the change to reviewable premium rates.

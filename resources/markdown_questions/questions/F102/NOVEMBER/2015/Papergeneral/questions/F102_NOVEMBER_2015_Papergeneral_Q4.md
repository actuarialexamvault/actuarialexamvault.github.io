## QUESTION 4

i.
Principles to be considered for developing a surrender value basis:
 Policyholders’ reasonable expectations (surrender value should be fair between
surrendering and continuing policyholders).
 Hence, surrender values should not too low at early durations compared with
premiums paid and should be consistent with maturity values at later durations taking
into account expected bonuses at maturity.
 Surrender values should not exceed the asset share over a reasonable time period
(should be affordable).
 Surrender values should include bonuses declared to date and consider whether all or
portion of terminal bonus should be granted on surrender.
 Surrender values should be consistent with disclosures at new business stage.
 Surrender values offered by competitors.
 The basis should not be subject to frequent change, unless dictated by financial
conditions. The basis should not lead to significant discontinuities in surrender values
over time, so new basis should ideally be consistent with current prescribed basis.
 Avoid selection against the insurer e.g. consider if market value adjustment should
apply.
 The basis should not be excessively complicated to calculate or explain and should be
capable of being documented clearly.
ii.
If surrender values are too high:
 Surrender values could be inconsistent with maturity values.
 It will not be easy to ensure equity with continuing policyholders or shareholders.
 The insurer will have to ‘take from’ maturities in order to make surrender values
affordable.
 Future bonus may have to be lower due to worse surrender experience.
 High surrender values could lead to a change in surrender/withdrawal behaviour
which might cause liquidity risk if more surrender payments are made than expected.
 High surrender values could encourage lapse and re-entry or selective withdrawals.
 If numbers of withdrawals increase, it will have an impact on the ability of remaining
policies to cover expenses.
 High surrenders may result in insufficient (or no) profit retained by insurer on
surrender.
 The product might become expensive due to costly surrender benefits and having to
keep higher reserves.
 Could lead to pressure on free assets/solvency position.
If surrender values are too low:
 Surrender values may look unreasonable relative to premiums paid or maturity value.
 Surrender values may look unreasonable compared to values offered by competitors.
 This will cause customer dissatisfaction and reputational risks.
 There is a risk of low product sales because of low surrender benefits are offered
resulting in overheads not being covered (due to reduced number of policies).

 High profits from low surrender values might not be sustainable.
 The regulator could intervene and impose minimum surrender values due to
policyholder reasonable expectations and treating customers fairly principles not
being met.

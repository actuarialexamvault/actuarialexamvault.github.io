## QUESTION 5

i.
Gross premium method:
Policyholder liabilities are determined as the present value of future benefit outgo plus the
present value of expected future expenses less the present value of expected future
premiums.
The policyholder liabilities will include an allowance for:
 Future death and loyalty bonus benefits
 Future administration expenses
 Future office premiums (taking missed premiums into account)
 Project to the terminal age for the whole-life death benefit
 Taking into account expected mortality rates and lapse rates, based on the
policyholder profile
 The regulatory regime will dictate whether these assumptions are set on a best-
estimate or prudent basis depending on the solvency margin requirements
 The discount rate should be based on the yields of assets matching the liabilities or
the risk-free rate
 The basis chosen should recognise profit in an appropriate way over the duration of
each policy
ii.
Data checks:
 Data should be checked for accuracy and completeness.
 Policy data from the previous valuation should reconcile with current policy data
taking policy movements (e.g. new business, lapses) into account.
 Reconciliations of policy data can be performed on number of policies, premiums,
sum assured.
 Movements in policy data (e.g. claims) should be checked against accounting data.
 Check data for consistency with the previous valuation and any changes to business
written over the period (e.g. average sum assured, ratio of premium to sum assured).
 Checks should be made for usual values (e.g. zero premium).
 Perform spot checks on individual data with policy contracts for accuracy.
Checks on the results:
 Reconcile results with those of the last supervisory valuation.
 Perform simple ratio checks on results e.g. the increase in reserves as a proportion of
premium.

 Construct a very simple “back of the envelope” model using a few model points to
represent the whole policy portfolio. Check the full model’s output against this for
order-of-magnitude errors.
 Perform sensitivity tests on key parameters and check for reasonability of changes in
results.
 Perform an analysis of surplus to explain the reason for the change in results.
 Perform an analysis of embedded value to explain reason for change in results.
iii.
Expected effect:
 Reduced lapse rates will have opposing effects on different elements of the gross
premiums valuation.
 Policies in early duration are likely to have a negative liability because of the upfront
commission payment.
 Reduced future lapses will cause the policyholder liability to be even more negative
because a part of the premium is expected to “repay” the upfront commission and we
are now expecting more policies to contribute (i.e. the expected present value of the
premiums is higher). This will reduce the liabilities.
 But this reduction in liabilities is counteracted by an increase in the liabilities due to
an:
o increase in the expected present value of loyalty benefit payments for
policies in-force less than 60 months (more policyholders are likely to
receive the benefit);
o increase in the expected present value of the death benefits (more policies
will be in-force at the time of death); and
o increase in the expected present value of the expenses.
 The overall effect on the liabilities of the change in the lapse assumption will depend
on the combined effect these components of the liability valuation.
iv.
Reducing lapse risk:
 Frequently monitor lapse experience and the factors that affect persistency of business
and update lapse assumptions for pricing and valuation models if necessary.
 Reduce the risk of mis-selling by improving product disclosures provided in the sale
process.
 Tailor remuneration structures to achieve a better balance between rewarding new
sales and persistency (e.g. use a combination of upfront and renewal commission).
 Improve mechanisms for collecting premiums (e.g. introduce direct debits) to avoid
missed premiums.
 Send reminders to policyholders to pay outstanding premiums encourage
policyholders to pay arrears premiums before policies will lapse.
 Improve ongoing customer service.
 Ensure that the premium rates and product features remain competitive compared to
other products in the market.
 Build the insurer’s brand and reputation in the market place through advertising and
promotion.
 Introduce other product features or bells and whistles.

 Train of sales’ staff to improve the quality of sale’s service.
 Introduce financial underwriting to ensure that the clients can afford the premiums.
Examiners’comments
Most candidates answered the question and scored reasonably. Candidates struggle to get the
balance of too much or too little detail correct. Bookwork marks were missed out.
For part (i) many candidates missed out on easy marks by simply not describing the
components and assumptions of the method. Candidates who gave a generic answer that did
not refer to the question generally scored poorly.
Part (ii) was generally better answered. Candidates who did not focus on the types of checks,
but on the detail of specific types missed out on marks.
For part (iii) candidates who focussed on or discussed the effect of each cashflow did very
well in this question, although few described the effect of duration properly. Some referred to
asset shares, which, if the application was correctly described, was also accepted. Many
students thought that they had to be sure about the overall effect and guessed.
Part (iv) was very well answered. Many candidates commented on simply reducing the
premium or increasing the premiums allowed to be missed without lapsing the policy.
Without adequate explanation of the risks involved these comments did not achieve marks.
Reasonable alternatives were also considered.

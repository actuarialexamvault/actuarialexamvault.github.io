## QUESTION 6

i.
(a) Embedded value profit can be calculated as the sum of:
 The shareholder-owned share of net assets, where net assets are defined as the excess
of assets held over those required to meet liabilities.
 The present value of future shareholder profits arising on existing business.
(b) Assumptions:
 Mortality rates and mortality improvements
 Disability rates
 Withdrawal rates
 Expenses and expense inflation
 Benefit inflation and claim sizes
 Premium collection rate
 Commission claw back rate (i.e. the rate at which commission claw backs is
successful)
 Investment returns, valuation discount rate or valuation interest rate
 Volatility of investment returns
 Future asset mix
 Future new business volumes (may affect the future per policy expense assumption)
 Future changes in tax rates
ii.
Discussion of the proposal to allow for analysis of Embedded Value (EV) profits:
 Using the analysis of EV profit means the remuneration scheme allows for changes in
the expected future profits from existing business across all future years, and not only

for the profits made during the most recent year. This aligns the remuneration scheme
more closely with the interest of shareholders.
 EV also allows for cost capital (which could in some cases be an allowance for
riskiness), so basing executive remuneration on EV profit means that cost of capital
(and potentially riskiness) is also allowed for.
 It more accurately reflects the impact of new business. Usually new business makes a
negative contribution to profits (due to new business strain), but should make a
positive contribution to EV.
 Executive remuneration can be determined more fairly, as aspects of the company’s
performance that are outside the management’s control can be excluded from the
executive remuneration assessment. For example, to the extent that investment
performance is outside the management’s control this can be excluded from their
remuneration assessment.
 Executive remuneration can be tailored to be specific to each executive’s role by only
using those elements of the EV profit that is relevant to them. For example, a sales
manager’s remuneration would be affected more heavily by the contribution to EV
from new business, while an investment manager’s remuneration will be affected
more heavily by the reduction in EV due to mismatch losses.
 It might bring the company’s remuneration scheme more in line with those of
competitors.
 It might not be appropriate to only base executive remuneration on EV profits, as the
company’s short term profits are also important and hence also need to be allowed for
(at least to some extent) within the executive remuneration scheme.
 Benchmarks for management should be set at a reasonable and appropriate.
 The actions of some executives might take a while to influence the EV, in which case
manual adjustments to their remuneration might be required.
iii.
Other reasons for performing an analysis of EV profits:
 Validate the calculations, assumptions and data used in the EV calculation.
 Reconcile the EV values for successive years.
 Show the financial effect of deviations between the best estimate assumptions and
actual experience.
 Show the financial effect of writing new business.
 Provide management information.
 Provide detailed information for publication in the company’s accounts or those of
any parent company.
 To be consistent with the reporting being performed by competitors.
Examiner comments
Part (i)(a) was mainly bookwork and was well answered.
For part (i)(b) many students erroneously mentioned that cashflows and reserve rates are
assumptions. This is not correct, as cashflows and reserves are calculated (i.e. not assumed).
A number of students discussed the risk discount rate (this is not an assumption about future
experience, but rather the return required by shareholders) and commission (commission is
usually calculated using pre-specified rules). These points did not score any marks.

Part (ii) was well answered by students who understood the question. However, a number of
students did not understand the term “EV profit” and hence commented on “after tax profits”
or simply on “EV”, which was not asked by the question. Some students made generic points
regarding performance remuneration, but did not link this to EV profits and hence did not
score marks. Some students mentioned that EV profits can be manipulated (e.g. if
management changed the assumptions and or by other methods). But, this issue is not unique
to EV calculations as it is also a concern for profits made during the year (as these profits
also depend on reserves, which are based on models and assumptions).
For part (iii) many students gave reasons for calculating EV instead of reasons for
performing an analysis of EV (AOEV). It should be noted that the AOEV cannot be used to
determine a value for a takeover or merger. Some aspects of the AOEV, e.g. VNB, can be used
for this, but this had to be mentioned explicitly to score marks. Many students mentioned that
an AOEV might be required by the regulator: this is unlikely, as regulators are concerned
with solvency and market conduct, not with profitability.

## QUESTION 1

(i)
Possible reasons include:
 ABC may consider the price offered to be very good value for money.
 ABC might not have sufficient experience of selling this product.
 ABC may need solvency relief, which could be achieved by passing on all of the risk
to the reinsurer.
 ABC may not see this as a core part of their business, and thus be happy for the
reinsurer to take on all of this risk and manage the portfolio.
 ABC may have no particular risk appetite for that particular market segment.
 ABC may want to reduce the volatility of its claims experience.
(ii)
Reasons why the reinsurer might agree:
 If the reinsurer has priced correctly the quoted price should result in the required level
of profit to the reinsurer.
 Expenses will probably be spread over a larger premium than initially expected, so it
should generate even better profit than originally priced.
 The reinsurer may agree to reinsure 100% of the risk to maintain a good relationship
with ABC if the remainder of ABC’s reinsurance programme is profitable to the
reinsurer.
Reasons why ABC might not agree:
 ABC has no interest in the experience and management of the portfolio if 100% of
the risk is reinsured.
 This could lead ABC to be less vigilant on underwriting and claims decisions.
 The reinsurer may specify strict underwriting and claims assessment requirements as
part of this agreement.
 This is especially true if the reinsurer cannot re-price the business at a later point in
time.
 The request to reinsure 100% of the business may lead the reinsurer to re-evaluate its
pricing (the reinsurer may have been too aggressive in the pricing initially).
(iii)
Risks taken on:
Counterparty risk / Credit risk – The reinsurer may be unable to pay the claims as they arise.
Legal risk – A reinsurance contract will need to be entered into, and no contract is completely
clear and unambiguous.
Systems risk – ABC will need to pay over the reinsurance premium (which have to be
calculated) and ensure that the reinsurer is informed of every life covered. This will need to
be done electronically and thus systems risks arise.
Operational risk – ABC will remain responsible for the underwriting and claims. Failure to
perform these processes as per the reinsurance contract would introduce operational risks.
Students lost out on a few easy marks due to not reading the question properly.

Part i was answered satisfactorily, but part ii was answered poorly with a large number of
students missing the point that 100% reinsurance reduces incentive to manage the
underwriting and claims properly. Most students also missed the point that the reinsurer had
already tendered, so the reinsurer clearly has terms on which at least a part of the risk can be
accepted. So to say that the reinsurer is concerned about the distribution channel or product
design does not make sense. The question targeted why it may or may not be feasible to take a
100% share.
In part iii most students mentioned the credit risk, but many students lost easy marks by not
mentioning the legal and operational risks being introduced.

## QUESTION 2

(i)
A key principle is that terms after alteration should be supportable by the earned asset share at
the date of alteration so as to avoid the company making a loss.
The profit expected from the contract after alteration should be appropriate e.g. if small
change, then same profit as before the alteration, big change, then bigger change to profit in
other words the method should be fair in terms of extracting a suitable amount of profit from
the altered policy.
Should take into account ‘boundary conditions’ i.e. should consider which alterations are
similar, and then terms offered should be similar/consistent between those alterations.
At later durations, be consistent with projected maturity values, allowing for premiums not
yet received
Be consistent with surrender values, so that surrender values pre- and post-alteration are
approximately equal.
Method adopted should be stable in that small changes in benefits should result in small
changes in premium (ignoring expenses of the alteration).
Terms offered should avoid lapse and re-entry.
Any increase in benefit may be subject to additional evidence of health (depending on scale of
change and when it occurs in policy’s lifetime).
The costs associated with carrying out the alteration should be recovered.
Method should be easy to calculate and to explain to policyholders.
The method should consider potential for selection against the insurer, and allow for this in
the basis, or disallow such alterations.
(ii)
Policyholders’ circumstances could change eg redundancy, making future premiums
unaffordable
Policyholders’ needs may change, making contract unsuitable eg if they have repaid their
interest-only mortgage and hence policyholders would find the flexibility to make policy PUP
attractive.
Policyholders may prefer continuation of contract in PUP form so as to still have life cover,
compared to the alternative of surrendering the contract.
Other valid comments or examples of how policyholders’ needs/circumstances/risk profiles
could have changed, were given credit.

(iii)
Asset share is likely to be significant, especially at later durations, so providing a paid-up
(PUP) benefit would be fair and affordable.
Competitive pressure from other insurers that offer PUP benefits.
Product differentiation if other insurers do not offer PUP benefits.
Regulation may require PUP benefits to be offered.
PRE based on information provided at time of sale or from terms specified in contract.
If no paid-up values are offered, the policyholder may surrender the policy, leading to
 Potential losses, if initial expenses have not been recovered
 Loss of potential future profits
Policyholders and their advisors may value the option, making the product more marketable
Policy still contributes towards fixed overheads
Assets do not need to be sold at unexpected and possibly unfavourable times
An ongoing relationship with policyholder is maintained providing marketing opportunities
The policyholder may be able to restart premiums at a later date
(iv)
The total profit expected from the paid-up contract will depend on the relationship between
the method and basis for calculating the policy value before alteration (profit released at time
of alteration), and method and basis for calculating policy value after alteration (profit
expected to emerge over the remaining term).
So create an equation of value: Policy value before PUP = Policy value after PUP + alteration
expenses.
PUP sum assured should be consistent with surrender values so that surrender values before
and after conversion are approximately equal.
Therefore use the surrender value at time of PUP as the policy value before alteration, thereby
releasing same amount of profit at time of PUP, as would be released for surrendering policy
as well as covering costs of alteration
The policy value after PUP would then be: (PUPSA)t Ax+t:n-t + eax+t:n-t (annual expenses
associated with PUP policies) + CAx+t:n-t (claims expenses),
And to ensure that policy still contributes to profit after becoming PUP, this should be
calculated using some margins in the assumptions so as to ensure that such margins will get
released as actual experience turns out better than expected.
(Marks can be awarded for any other well-reasoned suggestion eg current premium basis for
policy value after PUP to ensure contribution to profit after making PUP.)
(i)
Mainly bookwork.
(iii)
Many candidates failed to generate enough points by failing to consider how offering a paid-
up policy could be beneficial to the company (or more beneficial than losing the policy.).
Some candidates mentioned policyholder needs being met by offering such an option whilst
question specifically mentioned that this was not required.
(iv)
Candidates who scored well stated how profit could be extracted at point of alteration (by
considering difference between value on some well explained prospective basis vs earned
asset share) and how it could be extracted after alteration by difference between well

explained prospective basis and actual experience. Full marks could not be given if
candidates suggested realistic prospective for ‘before’ value and then a prospective basis
with margins for ‘after’ value, as that would not lead to a ‘reasonable’ amount of profit, but
rather ‘excessive’ profit to be made on paid-ups.

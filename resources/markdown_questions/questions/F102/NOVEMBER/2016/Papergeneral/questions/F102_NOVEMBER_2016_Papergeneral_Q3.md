## QUESTION 3

(i)
Longevity risk and policyholder behaviour
Conventional annuity
The life insurer carries the longevity risk of the annuity book i.e. it will have to fund the
annuity payments should policyholders live longer than expected.
As this is a developing country there may not be adequate data to understand longevity trends
increasing the risk exposure to the life insurer.
Special unit-linked annuity
Longevity risk is transferred to the policyholder.
There will be minor mortality risk at early stages of the policy.
Investment risk
Conventional annuity
The investment risk is carried by the life insurer.
The life insurer needs to ensure that the assets chosen to back the liabilities are adequate to
cover the annuity payments into the future.
As the market is developing, there are unlikely to be assets of adequate duration to back the
annuities increasing the investment risk (reinvestment risk).
Special unit-linked annuity
The investment risk is transferred to the policyholder to some extent.
The life insurer will, however, still be exposed to investment risk due to the following:
 Investment guarantee
 Its income from the product is dependent on the asset management fee which is
charged on the underlying assets under management.
Investment guarantee for unit-linked business
Offering the guarantees exposes the insurer to significant investment losses if market returns
are negative.
This risk can be even more significant in this case, due to the markets in this developing
country potentially being volatile.
Offering the guarantees will increase the reserving and capital requirements of the company.
This may increase the capital strain for this product.
The markets are unlikely to have available instruments to hedge the exposure, so it will be
difficult to reduce reserving and capital requirements by hedging the guarantees.
The company is unlikely to have the necessary skills and it may not be cost effective to obtain
the skills to manage the risk and valuation of the guarantees.
The cost of the guarantees may be prohibitive and result in lower value for the clients over the
long term. This will impact on the insurer’s reputation.

Expense risk
For both products there is a risk that expenses are higher than expected due to inflation being
higher than expected or poor management of costs.
Expense risk is exacerbated by the flexibility that policyholders have on the unit linked
product: if the rate at which policyholders draw down on their unit funds is greater than the
rate expected, the fees earned on the assets under management will be lower.
Competition
Conventional annuity
This product is currently offered by other competitors in the market. There is therefore a risk
that new business sales reduce and margins come under pressure as competition increases.
Special unit-linked annuity
The product is not offered by other providers at the moment so it may be possible to include
higher margins.
If the product is successful, however, there is a risk that competitors will enter the market
compressing margins.
Furthermore, unit linked annuities may be transferred between providers so there is a risk of
losing business to competitors in the future. This is not a risk for the conventional annuity.
Volume of new business
Conventional annuity
High levels of new business volumes will increase the initial capital strain on the insurer,
possibly putting pressure on the solvency of the insurer.
Special unit-linked annuity
There is a lower risk of high volumes causing strain/insolvency as the product offers no
longevity protection, and therefore has relatively smaller reserving requirements.
There will however still be new business strain as the upfront costs (3% commission +
administration) exceed the income (98% allocation) and the investment guarantee will most
likely result in additional reserves and/or capital requirements being held at policy inception.
Volumes will therefore still need to be actively managed if the insurer is unable to recognise
any of the future profits from the product upfront (via actuarial funding or negative non-unit
reserves).
Distribution – risk of poor advice
Conventional annuity
Brokers understand the product well as it is a common and simple product in the market.
There is low risk of poor advice.
Special unit-linked annuity
Brokers may not understand the product well as it is new to the market. There is risk of mis-
selling if adequate training is not provided to brokers.
This risk is increased by the fact that this is an annuity that does not cover longevity risk,
which is something that policyholders might not be used to.
Systems and controls
Conventional annuity
As this product has been on offer for a long time, systems and controls are likely to be
adequate.
Special unit-linked annuity

The new product will require significant system development in order to conduct unit pricing
and allow for the restrictions on drawdowns.
There is high operational risk due to the need to create new processes.
Data risk
Conventional annuity
Product has been sold for a long time so adequate data to price. However developing country
so there may still be volatility.
Special unit-linked annuity
No data on which to base fee structure and pricing. Will be difficult to know what average
rate of drawdown will be to set the fee.
Regulations
As the unit-linked product is new to the market there is a risk that the regulator may introduce
regulations related to the product that may result in further development and system costs if
the product needs to be changed.
There may be a risk of tax changes that impacts the profitability of the product.
There is a risk of fraud on both annuities but greater on conventional annuity as need to track
death of individuals.
Reputational risk
Conventional annuity
Low as the product is simple, clients understand what they will receive upfront. The only risk
is if the insurer cannot meet annuity payments.
Special unit-linked annuity
There is a reputational risk as there is a risk that policyholders do not understand the product.
If investment markets collapse, policyholders could be materially impacted.
There is a risk that the unit-linked fund is depleted before the death of the policyholder
leading to reputational risk.
The reputational risks related to investments are exacerbated by the fact that there single
investment fund determined by the insurer.
(iii)
Reduce the premium allocation rate to 97% (or less).
The company could employ actuarial funding or use negative non-unit reserves.
The maximum commission upfront could be reduced from 3%.
The company could introduce a bid offer spread charge.
The investment portfolio guarantees could be removed.
Overall the question was reasonably answered. Quite a few candidates did not
understand how a living/linked annuity worked compared to a conventional annuity
and thus did not identify the risks correctly. Some candidates did not lay out the
structure of their answers well resulting in overlap and/or missed points. A good
approach would have been to run through each risk type and then consider the impact
on each product.

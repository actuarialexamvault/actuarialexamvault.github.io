## QUESTION 4

(i)
Need assumptions for both the best estimates and margins to be included.
Mortality: pre claim and during claim (see below)
Claim termination rates, which are dependent on recovery rates and mortality rates
Discount rate/ investment return (to set up reserves): before claim and once claim is in
payment
Expense assumptions
 Renewal expenses and any on-going commission
 Claims assessment at claim inception and at any subsequent re-assessments
 Expense inflation rate
(ii)
The actuary will need to:
 Choose a suitable investigation period.
 Long enough so that the results are credible (enough data).
 Recent enough so that the results are relevant.
 Create homogenous groups.
 E.g. males and females; occupational classes
 Balanced against having sufficient data in each group so that results are
credible.
 Data issues may have to be dealt with (e.g. anomalies in the data etc.).
 Calculate exposed to risk and the number of claims received per group, used to
calculate crude rates for each group.
The actuary will then compare the results to the existing assumptions and either:
 Adjust the existing assumptions if the internal experience cannot be considered to be
fully credible, or
 Graduate the crude rates to replace the existing assumptions.
Further adjustments would be required to ensure that the assumption can be applicable to
future expected experience, in particular there is a need to allow for:
 The policy conditions (e.g. deferred period and replacement ratio) will influence the
claim inception and claim termination rates.
 Trends over time (e.g. due to medical advances).
 Correlation with economic environment (e.g. there is often higher claim inception
during economic down turn).
 The potential impact of government provision of welfare and tax.
Finalising the assumption would also involve considering other sources, to assess
reasonability (e.g. standard table, reinsurer or global data).
Include a margin for prudence.
(iii)
Potential impact on risk rates:
The company will now receive claims from relatively less severe disability conditions. As a
result, one can expect an increase in the claim inception rates.
However, claim termination rates are also likely to increase, at least at early claim durations.

 That is because it is more likely that claimants for the less severe conditions will
recover.
 However, once benefits are in payment, some claimants for the less severe conditions
may try to “prolong” payment, so the termination rates may not increase by as much
as one would initially expect.
Potential impact on mortality:
The average mortality for claimants is likely to decrease, given that now more relatively
healthy lives will be included.
Potential impact on expenses:
Claim assessment costs will increase, both at:
 initial claim stage (due to more claims having to be assessed), and
 the management stage of claims in payment (more frequent follow ups will be
necessary to manage claims from relatively less severe conditions).
Unlikely to have a significant impact on the investment return/ discount rate.
(i)
Most candidates failed to identify a sufficient number of assumptions and some identified
pricing rather than reserving assumptions.
(ii)
Few candidates gave a sufficiently detailed description of the full process to score well. Some
candidates failed to answer the question and considered mutli-state models rather than the
inception disability approach.
(ii)
Most candidates identified the impact on claims inception and expense experience. Better
candidates considered the impact of larger number of less severe claims on the claim
termination and mortality rates.

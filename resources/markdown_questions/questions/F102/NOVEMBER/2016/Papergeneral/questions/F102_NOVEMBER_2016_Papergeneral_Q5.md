## QUESTION 5

(i)
Profitability
The premiums need to be sufficient to cover claims, expenses and make a contribution to
profit.
The contribution to profit should be sufficient to meet the shareholders’ required return for
this product.
Critical illness incidence assumptions should cover the risk involved and allow for future
changes in the risk.
Expense loadings need to cover the marginal costs relating to the policy as well as make a
contribution to overhead expenses.
Revenue from the product will need to cover the costs of developing and launching the
product (e.g. marketing).
There are likely to be high initial expenses high lapses early in the duration of the policy (i.e.
the asset share is negative) will impact on the profitability of the insurer.

Sensitivity of the profit to changes in expected experience (e.g. claims or business volumes)
should be investigated.
The design of the product should aim to reduce the sensitivity of the profit of the insurer to
adverse changes in experience e.g. reduce initial expenses to reduce losses on lapses at early
durations.
The extent of cross-subsidies (e.g. relating to expense loading for small and large policies will
exacerbate the sensitivity of profit to mix and volume of business).
The cost of reinsurance will impact on the profitability.
Lower profitability might be acceptable if the company can cross sell other (more profitable)
products to the same policyholders.
Marketability and competitiveness
The marketability and competitiveness of the product of the will depend on the product
offering of the insurer’s competitors.
The competitiveness of the product will depend on the competitiveness of the premium for
this product.
Level premiums may have the advantage of certainty, but may be high initially for young
policyholders will low disposable income.
Focus on core conditions and fixed sum assured makes the product relatively simple and more
marketable and should make the product cheaper than other critical illness offerings that
cover a wider variety of conditions.
Due to the technical nature of claims definitions, these may be difficult for policyholders to
understand.
This product may need to be sold through brokers and sales agents so that features of the
product can be explained accurately to policyholders.
Risk characteristics
The uncertainty relating to future claims experience (e.g. critical illness diagnosis rates) for
critical illness is likely to increase the risk of the product, particularly since level guaranteed
premiums will apply for the duration of the contract.
Risks may be exacerbated by a lack of data on critical illness claims experience or changes in
future diagnoses of conditions due to medical advances.
Margins may be included in the premium for the higher levels of uncertainty but this will
contradict the need for competitive premiums.
The insurer should consider whether there are any features in the product design or target
market that would increase the risk of the business (e.g. targeting workplaces where there is a
higher risk of employees suffering from lung cancer).
The insurer will need to consider whether underwriting processes will be sufficient to manage
the anti-selection risk reinsurance may be used as a risk mitigation strategy.
(ii)
Pricing using a deterministic model:
 Determine a set of model points which represent the expected new business based
on the profile of the existing business allowing for any expected changes in the
profile.
 Set assumptions for the expected critical illness diagnosis rates, mortality,
morbidity, lapses, expenses, investment returns and tax.
 These assumptions should reflect that expected future experience of the lives
covered and the economic environment.

 For each model point project the cashflows allowing for projected solvency and
reserving requirements.
 The following cash flows are required in the projections: premiums, claims,
expenses and investment returns on reserves.
 The future profits are then calculated as the net cash flow, less the increase in
reserves.
 The company should discount the projected profit at a risk discount rate that
reflects the return required by the company and the level of risk attached to the
profits.
 The premiums will be set so that the company achieves its required profit target.
 The premiums need to be considered for marketability.
 This may lead to reconsideration of the design of the product, changes to the
distribution channel, reconsideration of the profit requirement etc.
 The profit from these model points, scaled up for the expected new business can
be incorporated into a model of the whole company.
 It may be possible that the required level of profit can be reached in aggregate
without each individual model point being profitable in its own right.
 However if this is the case the company may be exposed to the risk of a change in
the mix of business.
 Once acceptable premiums have been determined for the model points, premiums
for all product variations can be determined.
This question was relatively poorly answered.
(i)
The majority of candidates failed to write sufficient points to score well. Candidates failed to
discuss a wide enough range of points in sufficient detail, A number of candidates made
vague points e.g. uncertainty in claims and failed to relate points to the product in the
question with a sufficient level of explanation.
(ii)
Better candidate gave a logical step-by-step explanation of the full modelling process.
Weaker candidates only considered parts of the modelling process.

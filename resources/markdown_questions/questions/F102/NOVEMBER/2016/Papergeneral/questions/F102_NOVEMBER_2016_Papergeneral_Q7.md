## QUESTION 7

(i)
The extent to which deferral of profit distribution is achieved depends on the size of the
terminal dividend relative to the dividends paid out during the lifetime of the contract
(reversionary bonuses).
The greater the terminal dividend element, the greater the deferral of profit distribution since
the profits are only distributed on maturity or surrender of the contract.
Both bonus distribution methods support declaring bonuses using a combination of
reversionary and terminal bonuses.
In practice, the contribution method provides less deferral of profit distribution than the
additions to benefits method.
(ii)
Since it is a small company, it would need to defer the distribution of profits as much as
possible for the following reasons:
 To provide a cushion of free assets to absorb worse than anticipated experience (e.g.
claims experience).
 To enable the insurer to write more new business than would otherwise be possible,
since the insurer will have sufficient free assets to absorb the new business strain
associated with writing new business.
 To finance the acquisition of new sales channels, product developments, systems, etc.
 To provide the insurer with the investment freedom to invest in riskier asset classes,
such as equities, to achieve higher investment returns; which can be passed on to
policyholders.

 Profit deferral provides a cushion against which movements in volatile asset values
can be absorbed without threatening the solvency of the insurer.
 To keep capital requirements as low as possible.
 To meet the expectations of the with profits policyholders. The policyholders may
have expectations that the insurer will smooth investment returns, by deferring profit
distribution in years when investment returns are very good and distributing more
than earned during the years when investment returns are poor.
Factors to consider when determining the bonus distribution approach
Policyholders may, however prefer greater certainty that comes from less deferral, or they
may prefer the expectation of higher returns overall that deferral might bring.
Shareholders who may prefer the certainty of early distribution and less deferral.
The extent to which deferral of profit distribution is achieved depends on the balance of the
profit distributed via terminal bonus, as opposed to reversionary bonus.
Terminal bonuses provide the greatest deferral of distribution of profit so company should
aim for as much distribution in terminal bonus form as possible provided that contracts will
still be marketable.
For reversionary bonuses, a super-compound reversionary bonus structure achieves the
greatest deferral of profit distribution, followed by a compound bonus structure, with a simple
reversionary bonus structure achieving the least deferral of distribution of profit.
So the company could propose a super-compound bonus structure, provided that it is
marketable.
When declaring its regular bonuses, the company should be aware that PRE will be formed by
these bonus declarations and hence should make sure it’s in line with bonus earning capacity
of the book of business.
The bonus philosophy should satisfy the requirement of equity between different groups and
different generations of policyholder.
Ideally each policyholder should get the share of the surplus earned by their policy. This
should be determined by reference to policy asset share.
The system should be flexible enough to deal equitably with different types of surplus. The
need for this arises as different sources of surplus result in surplus that emerges in different
patterns. Special reversionary bonuses under additions to benefits method will allow for this.
Weaker candidates seem to struggle with discussing a sufficient range of points to justify a
distribution approach.
(i)
Generally well answered book-work.
Some candidates did not focus on describing the differences in the extent of profit deferral
under the two surplus distribution methods. No marks were awarded for generic explanations
of the “Contribution Method” and the “Additions to benefits” method.
(ii)
Better candidates tailored their answers to the specifics of the question. Weaker candidates
listed generic consideration items, without explanation. Candidates generally struggled to
generate enough distinct and well-explained points to gain full marks.

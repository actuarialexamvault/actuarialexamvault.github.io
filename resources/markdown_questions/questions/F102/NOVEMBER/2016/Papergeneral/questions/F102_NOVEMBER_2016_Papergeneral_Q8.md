## QUESTION 8

(i)
The distribution channel may impact on the product experience as follows:
Expected mortality and withdrawal experience through the following:
 financial sophistication of the target market
 who initiated the sale
 extent to which distribution channel explains product features accurately
 level of underwriting
 demographic characteristics
Expected expense experience through the following:
Sales volumes will be affected by how well the distribution channel does which will impact
on expense experience and number of policies that can cover overhead expenses.
Expenses of the different channels to the company may also be different i.e. extent of admin
required to get policies on the books.
(ii)
A guaranteed annuity option (GAO) is likely to be exercised when interest rates fall below the
implied guaranteed rate. Hence the company could use the market value of any derivative
which will offer a payoff in such circumstances, e.g.
 Interest rate floor (i.e. a put option on interest rates, with the strike rate being equal to
the implied guaranteed interest rate).
 A call option on the bonds that would be necessary to ensure the guarantee was met,
i.e. at an exercise price which generated the required fixed rate of return.
 Alternatively, the GAO is also equivalent to an option to swap floating rate payments
at the option date for fixed rate receipts sufficient to meet the guaranteed annuity
payments (swaption).
The practical difficulties include:
 Suitable options or swaptions may not be available (e.g. that match the insurer’s
specific level of implied guaranteed interest rates, or specific policy maturity dates).
 If derivatives exist, they may not be traded on the open market, so that prices are not
easily obtainable.
 The derivatives might not be sufficiently marketable and liquid i.e. quoted prices
might not be appropriate for the volumes required by the insurer.
 Over-the-counter derivatives (versus exchange traded) expose the insurer to greater
credit risk, which is likely to reflect in a lower price; thus suitable adjustment for
credit risk should be made by the insurer to avoid under-valuing the guarantees,
however this may be difficult and subjective.
iii.
The company is likely to currently be invested in a mixture of fixed-interest securities of
appropriate duration to match the guaranteed sum assured and bonuses already declared and
assets producing higher returns (e.g. equity and property) for the discretionary part of the
liability.
The level of investment in higher risk assets will depend on the level of reversionary bonuses
and the level of free assets.

Impact of the guaranteed annuity option (GAO):
 There may not be a direct impact on the investment strategy for the with-profits
(WP) asset portfolio if the insurer is satisfied that the investment risk relating to
the guarantee is not likely to impact on its targeted solvency position.
 The company could decide to purchase suitable derivatives in investment markets
to hedge the GAO liability (if these assets exist and are available at a reasonable
cost).
 The company could also follow a matching strategy by investing in longer
duration fixed-interest securities to manage the exposure to changes in the interest
rates due to the GAO.
 However, this may go against policyholder expectations for maximising maturity
benefits on with profits policies.
 It will also be very difficult to determine the proportion of investments that need
to be switched to longer duration fixed interest securities, due to this depending
on the proportion of policyholders that decide to convert their maturity benefit to
an annuity (which is very uncertain)
 If the insurer wants to depart from the matched position the insurer could use
asset liability modelling to determine the cost of the GAO and its impact on the
solvency level of the insurer under different asset allocations and select assets
that maintain a balance between additional returns and the solvency level that is
acceptable to the insurer.
 In the event of a mismatch, additional reserves may be required. This is likely to
be invested in low volatility assets e.g. cash.
 In the event that the GAO liability is not matched, shareholder might want to
reduce risk elsewhere e.g. by closer matching of the guaranteed liability under the
WP portfolio, which in turn may lead to lower returns and bonuses for WP
policyholders.
Impact of adding brokers and direct selling to distribution:
Withdrawal experience:
 Policyholder withdrawals may be higher for sales by brokers: brokers may try to
“churn” business between companies to maximise commission income, or for
justified reasons such as switching to more competitive products.
 Policyholder withdrawals are likely to be higher for direct sales: the absence of
advice may lead to more policyholders realising that policies purchased were
inappropriate for their needs. This is especially true for complex products such as
this one, which has both with-profit features and a guaranteed option.
 The impact of higher withdrawal rates on investments is that:
 Asset duration should be shorter (e.g. shorter term bonds).
 A greater proportion of assets need to be liquid (e.g. cash).
 Depending on surrender value penalties and policyholder expectations for
surrender values, asset values may need to be more stable (e.g. hold fewer
equities).
 The overall impact may be lower returns and lower bonuses.

The need for competitive terms:
 Business sold through brokers needs to be very competitive. The impact on
investment strategy is that there is greater pressure for higher returns and higher
bonuses. This can be achieved by investing in higher risk assets (e.g. equities).
 Business sold through direct channels is potentially less sensitive to competitive
pressures although clients might be less sophisticated and less tolerant of volatile
returns, this would suggest a lower risk investment portfolio is needed.
 Following different investment strategies for the different distribution channels
might not be possible initially, due to the volumes from the new distribution
channels being too small, with unique investment strategies only being followed
when volumes are sufficiently large.
The overall impact should reflect all of the above factors and should strike a balance
between them.
The question was poorly answered in general.
(i)
The majority of candidates failed to consider a sufficiently wide range of points. Weaker
candidates structured their solutions around the three types of distribution channels resulting
large number of repeated points.
(ii)
The majority of candidates failed to consider a range of possible derivatives structures that
would replicate the guarantee and to give a sufficient range of practical difficulties. Stronger
candidates identified when the guarantee would bite and were able to explain replicating
derivative strategies. Weaker candidates gave vague points e.g. call options and discussed
irrelevant points e.g. constructing replicating portfolios and risk of guarantee in detail.
Some students discussed mortality options rather than investment guarantees.
(iii)
Many candidates failed to give sufficiently detailed description of the appropriate strategy for
existing product structure and then use this to build discussion for changes in strategy. Many
candidates failed to demonstrate understanding of assets that would match the cashflows for
the annuity at guaranteed rates.
Some students discussed less important issues (e.g. matching expenses) at the expense of
discussing assets that match the liabilities. Many students did not consider the impact of a
change in investment strategy on meeting policyholder expectations for bonus declarations
and failed to consider mismatching and the effect of the solvency requirements and free assets
on the investment strategy.
A number of students discussed changing the bonus distribution strategy, rather than the
investment strategy.

## QUESTION 1

i.
Factors to consider:
 Policyholders’ expectations:
 Established by the bonus philosophy including the split between current
bonuses and terminal bonuses and the expected use of an Market Value
Adjustment (MVA).
 Policyholder Reasonable Expectations (PRE) will be informed by past bonus
declarations and by what competitors are declaring.
 Policyholders would also expect to see performance in excess of inflation.
 Investment returns:
 Consider the actual returns earned as well as expected future returns.
 The insurer does not want to distribute more than what it is earning, however,
it is easy for policyholders to compare the bonus with an approximate
investment return earned in the market and the ability to significantly under-
declare is limited in times of good returns.
 Guarantees:
 The insurer will need to meet any minimum guarantees.
 Unitised With-profits (UWP) policies do not generally have significant
guarantees, but the minimum rate that can be declared is usually zero.
 Funding level/free assets:
 Does the insurer need to retain some of the investment return to boost the
funding level of the portfolio?
 Or can it increase bonuses from previous under-declarations?
 Asset share will give an indication of the funding/maximum bonus that could
be declared.
 Bonus should also be sustainable, though there is more room for different
annual declarations in UWP policies.
 Solvency
 The bonus declaration should not impact the solvency of the company.
 Profits from other sources e.g. mortality, expenses:
 Include these in the declaration as it is a mutual.
 These are unlikely to be large, but could provide some additional benefit if
experience was good.
ii.
Consequences of the error:
 This depends on the effect that the correct information would have had on the
bonus declaration.
 If the bonus declared was at the maximum level possible, no action is required.
 However, the insurer should use the correct asset shares as opening values for
the new calculations.
 If the bonus could have been higher:
 The insurer would have to decide whether to implement a higher bonus or
not.
 Regulations may require a correction to be made.

 A correction to in-force policyholders’ records will be required.
 A revisit to the policies that had surrendered during the year will also be
required.
 The amounts involved may be very small in the overall context.

**[Total 8]**

Part (i) was very poorly answered by most candidates. Candidates did not appreciate the
difference between setting a bonus philosophy and declaring an annual bonus within the
established bonus philosophy. Very few candidates considered that the differences resulting
from a UWP product and a surprisingly large number of candidates considered the
shareholders in their declaration.
For part (ii) better answers recognised that this is not a large error and it may not have had
any impact on the bonus declaration in the previous year.

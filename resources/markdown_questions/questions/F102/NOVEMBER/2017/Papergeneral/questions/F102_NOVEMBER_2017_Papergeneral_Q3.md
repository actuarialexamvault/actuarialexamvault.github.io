## QUESTION 3

i.
Errors in unit pricing:
 Not changing the pricing basis when the flows for the portfolio change direction.
 Incorrectly allowing for taxation in the unit pricing process.
 Using the incorrect bid offer spread.
 Errors in the pricing of assets.
 Unfairly/inequitably treating policyholders due to timing mismatches or
rectifying past errors.
 Inaccurate/outdated current asset and current liability values.
 System malfunctions or breakdowns resulting in delays in available pricing.
ii.
Risks faced by the life insurer:
Market risk
 The risk that the value of the assets reduces and therefore the future fees reduce.
Expense risk
 The risk that expenses incurred are higher than expected.

 The risk that expense inflation is higher than expected.
 This risk is further increased if the management fee cannot be increased.
Lapse risk
 The risk that policyholders leave resulting in a loss of the income stream.
 Further, given the high new business strain early lapses will result in significant
losses.
Operational risk
 The risk that the funds are not appropriately invested to match liabilities.
 The risk that there are errors in the unit pricing process.
New business risk
 Due to the high level of new business strain, higher volumes than expected pose a
risk to the solvency of the insurer.
 Due to only offering one portfolio, there is a risk that volumes are lower than
expected and as a result overheads on the product are not recovered.
Tax/regulatory risk
 There is a risk that changes in taxation or regulation reduce the profitability of the
product.
Reputational risk
 Due to having only one portfolio, if the portfolio performs poorly, this may result
in a mass exit of policyholders.
iii.
Adding the three new portfolios:
Advantages:
 Increases the options available to the investor and therefore improves the ability
to meet client needs.
 Improves competitiveness of the product.
Disadvantages:
 Additional administration complexity.
 Can result in mis-selling if advisors are not adequately equipped to give advice to
clients which portfolio aligns with client needs and expectations.
Adding the guarantee:
Advantages:
 Competitive advantage over the offering from collective investment schemes.
 The market is sophisticated so it will be possible to hedge the guarantee.
Disadvantages:
 Will result in capital strain and volatility in profits if the guarantee is not hedged.
 Will require additional systems and staff who are able to determine the exposure
of the guarantee and hedge this in the market which will be costly.
 Will result in additional costs to the policyholder which they may not clearly
understand.
Reducing the management fee:
Advantage:
 May increase volumes as the product will become more competitive.

Disadvantages:
 May reduce profitability of the product if reduced margin is not more than offset
by increased volumes.
 Whilst volumes may increase initially, competitors can easily reduce their fees
with the result that the overall profitability in the industry reduces.
Changing the commission structure:
Advantages:
 Reduces the new business strain, capital requirements and lapse risk by better
matching timing of cashflows.
 Lapse rates likely to reduce as distribution force will be incentivised to get
policyholders to retain their policies.
Disadvantages:
 Distribution force unlikely to sell the product if competitor products offer upfront
commission.
 Will need to incur system costs and administration costs to change commission
structure.

**[Total 14]**

Overall the question was well answered. Some candidates did not adequately understand
unitised product structures. As an example, for the point on introducing guarantees on the
product some candidates stated that the premium would need to be increased rather than the
charge on the unit fund. There were also a few candidates who did not understand the unit
pricing process and referred to errors that may occur in determining asset shares rather than
unit prices.

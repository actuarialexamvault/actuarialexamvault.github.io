## QUESTION 4

i.
Coinsurance on original terms:
The insurance company sets the premium, and the reinsurance premium is in direct
proportion to this.
The amount of commission agreed with the reinsurer sets the price of the reinsurance
arrangement, and is usually very significant.
Coinsurance using level risk premium approach:
The reinsurer sets a level premium for its share of the risk, based on its share of the full
sum assured.
The insurer then calculates its own premium rates in the knowledge of the reinsurance
premiums it will be paying.
The reinsurance commission is usually not significant.
ii.
The main purpose of underwriting is to manage risk. This can be done in the following ways.
 It can protect an insurance company from anti-selection.
 Given that a reinsurer normally sees larger risks and more impaired lives, anti-
selection is a concern for the reinsurer and needs to be managed.

 Financial underwriting will help to reduce the risk from over-insurance and is
important especially with high sums assured.
 The underwriting process will enable a life insurance company to identify lives
with a substandard health risk and can be used for making a decision to reject the
proposal or to accept the proposal on special terms, on the appropriate price for
the risk.
 For the substandard risks, the underwriting process will identify the most suitable
approach and level for the special terms to be offered.
 These terms may be an additional loading on the premium or alternatively an
exclusion cause (or other valid terms and conditions).
 Adequate risk classification within the underwriting process will help to ensure
that all risks are rated fairly.
 Underwriting will help to ensure that actual mortality experience does not depart
too far from that assumed in the pricing of the contracts being sold.
 Underwriting is the process that aligns the risks written by a company with the
pricing performed by the actuary.
 Reinsurers also aim to manage their exposure to certain countries and occupations
and will underwrite for these risks. Underwriting will allow them the chance to
place exclusions for travel to certain countries and types of injuries obtained for
certain occupations.
 Avocational underwriting also allows an insurer or reinsurer to manage their
exposure to hazards pursuits.
iii.
The chief actuary would need to consider the following
 What the cedant’s motivation is for the request to reduce the underwriting
requirements.
 Consider the effectiveness of the existing underwriting requirements.
 If the insurer’s current underwriting guidelines are appropriate and consistent
with those used by reinsurer.
 Determine whether the current underwriting practice is still appropriate and
whether the market is happy with this.
 Consider whether a change in the underwriting approach is necessary due to
different underwriting practices that have evolved in the market and advances in
medical technology.
 Consider the extent of the proposed change:
 Identify what the reduction in underwriting would entail, is this limited to
underwriting questions on the application form or does it also include less
onerous medical reports or specialist testing or a combination of both.
 Consider whether limited underwriting applies to all products or only a
limited set of products.
 Consider the importance of underwriting to this business:
 Consider the type of products being written. Some products will require
more underwriting than others, e.g. Income Protection products. However,
there may be ways to increase premiums to account for the extra risk taken
on.
 Consider the distribution channel and type of lives purchasing the product.

 The level and amount of underwriting carried out by competitors.
 Being slightly different from the market standards may lead to an accumulation
of anti- selection. Underwriting attempts to minimise this by evaluating the risks
associated with each case.
 Consider other ways to assess and manage the risk with reduced underwriting
 Consider the type of information that will no longer be obtained through
underwriting and determine if there are alternative methods of obtaining the
information.
 Consider alternative ways to manage the risk e.g. limit sum assured.
 Whether insurer is open to the idea of managing the risk in alternative ways
by adapting product terms, e.g. adding pre-existing condition terms.
 Look at implementing decision tree underwriting processes where only
certain medical, lifestyle or financial underwriting is conducted when
specified answers to certain questions are given.
 Data analytics to identify preferred lives for reduced underwriting.
 Proxies for managing risks.
 Consider the underwriting expertise/experience of the insurer’s team and whether
the team is likely to be able to effectively implement alternative risk mitigation
measures.
 Determine the potential impact on the reinsurer’s book and look to see if there is
a possibility for cross-subsidies.
 Consider the reinsurance structure. If a quota share agreement is in place then
both the insurer and reinsurer have a vested interest in managing the risk. If a
surplus treaty is in place, then the insurers risk is limited and there is more
incentive for the reinsurer to manage the risk appropriately.
 Identify if there are any regulatory restrictions on underwriting.
 The reduction in underwriting expenses e.g. few medical examinations compared
to the increase in risk of anti-selection and increase claim costs by not
underwriting.

Part (i) was bookwork and was well answered.
Part (ii) was relatively straight forward, but some candidates failed to cover a sufficient
range of relevant points. Candidates needed to be brief in their explanations and some
candidates wasted time giving to much detail on financial underwriting and then failed to
give a sufficient breadth points on general reasons for underwriting.
Part (iii) was poorly answered. Again many candidates did not cover a sufficient range of
points to do well in the question. Many candidates did not consider the impact of a change in
underwriting on the claims experience of the insurer and then how this will influence the
reinsurer’s decision. The majority of candidates failed to consider other ways of managing
the risk of anti-selection (e.g. introduce a waiting period) or using alternative sources of
information to assess the risk of the potential policyholder. A number candidates missed the
basic points of reasons for requesting the change and whether the proposed new approach is
consistent with market practice.

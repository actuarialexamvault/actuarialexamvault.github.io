## QUESTION 6

i.
Principles:
 Take policyholders’ reasonable expectations into account.
 At early durations, the surrender values should not appear too low compared with
premiums paid taking into account any projections provided at the new business
stage.
 At later durations, surrender values should be consistent with projected maturity
values.
 Surrender values should not exceed earned asset shares, in aggregate, over a
reasonable time period.
 Take account of surrender values offered by competitors.
 Should not be subject to frequent change, unless dictated by financial conditions.
 Should not be excessively difficult to calculate, taking into account the
computing power available.
 Should be capable of being documented clearly.
 Should avoid selection against the insurer.
ii.
Assumptions:
Interest rates:
 It is likely that LifeCo covers the without-profit liabilities with fixed interest
investments, chosen to give a reasonable matching by term.
 We can expect that the average duration for someone of Joe’s age is longer than
what is expected in Joe’s specific case.
 So we expect that XYZ likely uses an interest rate assumption corresponding to a
shorter duration.
 Whether the annual interest rate used in the calculation is higher or lower would
depend on the shape of the yield curve(s).
 However, we can generally expect that there is less of an effect of discounting in
the calculations of XYZ compared to LifeCo.
Mortality rates:
 The basis will be based on their expectation of future mortality, which may or
may not be the same as the pricing basis.
 LifeCo is likely to use a standard basis of mortality to calculate the prospective
value of policies.
 The basis may even allow for lighter mortality as it would not expect ill-health
policyholders to lapse.
 This will have the effect of extending the expected future lifetime of the policy.
 This in turn will produce a corresponding decrease in the surrender value.
 XYZ is likely to perform this calculation using a specialised mortality basis
derived specifically for Joe.
 This is something that will not be present in LifeCo’s calculations.
 Medical underwriters at XYZ may have given input on both the shape and the
level of the future mortality.

 Given that the actual future outlook is so poor, we can expect that LifeCo has a
much shorter expected future lifetime in their calculations.
Expenses:
 LifeCo would need to include a regular/annual expense assumption in their
prospective calculation.
 There will also be an expense incurred on the death of a policyholder which
needs to be included in the calculation.
 These assumptions will be set with reference to their most recent expense
investigations.
 The ongoing and terminal expenses contribute to a larger surrender value.
 Margins will not be included here as it will only make the prospective surrender
value larger.
 XYZ Brokers will need to include a significant upfront expense in their
calculation, since they would need to perform substantial underwriting even to be
in a position to offer terms.
 Once a policy is purchased, however, the ongoing expenses should be quite
minimal compared to LifeCo’s, since they only have to administer the premium
payment of the policy.
 They may also have an expense on the insured’s death.
 However, this should be minimal since the life office itself will do all the claims
underwriting and investigations etc.
 In the case of XYZ, the lack of significant expenses contribute to a potentially
better offer.
Inflation:
 The assumed inflation rate would probably be chosen to be consistent with the
interest rate/investment return assumption by both companies.
 Alternatively, the expenses can be discounted using a real interest rate.
 This may or may not be the same depending on the assumed expected average
future duration of the policy.
 We would expect that XYZ is a lot less exposed to inflation risk than LifeCo,
since their view of the future lifetime is much less.

**[Total 16]**

Part (i) was generally answered very well, with most candidates getting the majority of the
marks on offer. A general observation that can be made here is that some candidates still
write too much for the simple “state” instruction, wasting valuable time.
Part (ii) was mostly poorly answered. Candidates who structured their answers using the
main assumptions as headings did better. The focus was on comparing assumptions and not
discussing the merits of a prospective surrender value calculation, as the latter was provided
as a given in the question. Very little practical thinking and application was demonstrated in
general.
A common error was candidates assuming that somehow XYZ Brokers need to estimate what
the life office’s expense and investment assumptions should be, when they clearly need to use
their own. Most candidates also did not write nearly enough for the number of marks on offer.

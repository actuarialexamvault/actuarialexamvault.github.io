## QUESTION 1

i.
The level term life policy provides for the financial needs of the family in the event of death of
the policyholder while the children are still of school going age.
Term life cover is provided at lower cost for the same level of benefit than other products that
could also meet this financial need (e.g. whole life cover).
A low cost product is particularly important for young families where disposable income is low.
The option to extend the term of the cover for a further five years provides an additional benefit
without the concern of additional underwriting if the insured’s health has deteriorated, which
allows for an extension of the term if the child has not yet finished school or is pursuing further
education
ii.
The insurer is exposed to the following risks:
• Mortality experience e is worse than expected; this is the main risk of the policy.
• Anti-selection at the start of the policy and at the date of exercise of the option to extend
the term of the contract.
• These risks may result in the additional premium for the option to extend the policy
being insufficient to meet the actual costs of the option.
• Selective withdrawals since healthy lives may withdraw to get a cheaper policy with
no option, especially if the loading for the option is high.
• Early withdrawal at times when the asset share is negative.
• Expense risk can be substantial, as the premiums are relatively small.
• Expense inflation may be higher than expected.
• There is some concentration risk, since one death or event, might trigger multiple
policies.
• Given the low level of reserves, investment risk is minimal.
• New business volumes and/or mix risk.
iii.
The following items would appear in a cashflow model
a.
• Option up-take
• Mortality rates before and after option take up
• Benefit levels
• Expenses relating to administering the option
• Premium rates on standard lives at time of exercising the option
• Withdrawal rates
• Allowance for the additional reserves before and after the take up of option

b.
Stochastic projections allow a probability distribution function to be assigned to future
unknown parameters in particular take-up rates and mortality rates after the extension of the
contract.
An understanding of the variation in results (with probabilities attached) might be useful to
assess the cost of the option through a distribution of results, which also allows the life insurer
to set the premium at various levels of prudence.
In a stochastic model the interaction between variables can be explicitly included, enabling the
effect of the interactions to be assessed. For example lower take-up rates would imply worse
mortality.
But stochastic models are relatively complex.
Results are sensitive to:
• the distribution chosen
• values of the parameters of the distributions chosen
Also, it may be difficult to select a distribution and model these variables reliably.
In these circumstances a deterministic approach with testing of appropriate scenarios may
provide results that do not differ materially from results using the stochastic approach, so the
cost of the option could be modelled using a deterministic cashflow model.
Examiners’ comments:
Part (i) was generally well answered, but many candidates missed the comment on term
insurance being cheaper. Many candidates commented on this being a contract to transfer
wealth from one generation to the next, which it is clearly not, given the limited term of the
contract.
Part (ii) was also well answered, with most students scoring well. Better candidates explored
the risk around the option to extend the term as well, as opposed to the generic comments
around term assurance risks.
Part (iii) was answered well, but many candidates forgot to include the standard premium rates
applicable at the time.
Part (iv) saw most students only commenting on generic aspects of stochastic modelling, with
little attempt at commenting on which variables might be modelled stochastically or where
might we expect to observe some interaction between variables. The best answers included
comments around the fact that a deterministic approach might very well give the same answer.
Many students commented that stochastic model will give “non-zero” costs to the option, which
is more applicable to investment options, in fact we can expect that any deterministic approach
will also give a non-zero cost to an option such as this.

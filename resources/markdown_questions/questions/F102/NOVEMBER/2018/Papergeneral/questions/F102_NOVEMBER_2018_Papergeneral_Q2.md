## QUESTION 2

i.
Underwriting can help by:
• Protecting the insurer against anti-selection.
• Identifying the lives with substandard health risk.
• Identifying special terms to offer to the substandard risks.
• Helping ensure that all risks are rated equitably.
• Helping ensure that mortality experience is consistent with the pricing basis.
• Reducing the risk from over-insurance (through financial underwriting).
• Can also assist with claims underwriting to make sure only valid claims are paid.
ii.
Simplified underwriting, relative to stringent underwriting:
• The majority of the underwriting will be done from the application form and
underwriting questionnaire.
• The underwriting could be done over the telephone. This would replace part/all of
the questionnaire.
• No medical tests would be required – unless something on the questionnaire
suggests that tests are required.
• No visit to a medical specialist (nurse or doctor) for a check-up would be required
– unless something on the questionnaire suggests this is required.
• Very limited financial underwriting, perhaps just stating income, or a salary slip to
prove income (although the latter is rare in South Africa).
• There are likely to be more accept/decline cases, and less specially rated cases or
cases with exclusions.
iii.
Stringent medical and financial underwriting may be a barrier to making sales, because:
• It slows the process down, which may result in the policyholder not completing the
process, or going with another insurer which has a quicker process.
• The broker is also more likely to suggest an insurer that has a simpler and/or faster
underwriting process.
• People often do not want to be subjected to the hassle/inconvenience of medical
tests and many questions.
• If there is financial underwriting, people may not want to provide details of their
earnings, or assets and liabilities.
• The more stringent the process, the more likely the insurer is to find something
wrong, and hence load or decline the case.
There are costs associated with stringent underwriting, and a more simplified approach could
result in significant cost savings to the company. For example:
• Fewer medical tests.
• Less time spent by the underwriters.
• Lower administration cost.
• These costs may not be commensurate with the improvement in mortality due to
underwriting, cost savings may lead to lower premiums overall.

iv.
The company could enter into a quota share reinsurance arrangement.
This will:
• Allow a sharing of the mortality losses (if any).
• Provide access to technical assistance in setting the underwriting process.
The company should ensure that its new process is in line with the industry, if other companies
are offering this approach. If it is not in line it is at risk of being selected against.
The company will need to train its underwriting staff how to underwrite, and identify risks, with
less information than they are used to.
Marketing can be used to target a healthier sub-group in the target market with this product.
The claims process needs to be amended to allow for potential misrepresentation at the initial
underwriting stage.
The premiums need to be recalculated based on the expected mortality for the product under
the new underwriting approach. All other things being equal, the premiums should increase,
although the cost savings need to be taken into account.
The process should be monitored to check if lives with significantly different mortality (than
expected in the recalculated premiums) are entering the risk pool. This can be done at
application stage, i.e. gender, age, socio-economic class split, or at claims stage, although it is
probably too late by then.
If it is possible to change the design of the contract the company could introduce a waiting
period for non-accidental death, or introduce exclusions for pre-existing conditions.
Reviewable premiums can also assist to correct any underestimation of the risk cost.
But these changes may be unpopular with policyholders and be inconsistent with principles of
treating customers fairly.
Examiners’ comments
Part (i) was bookwork and very well answered, with the vast majority of candidates listing at
least four of the available points.
In part (ii) most candidates could comment on the lack of medical tests and/or doctor’s visits,
but few explored the fact that underwriting could now be done via telephone and/or internet
channels, which can also be seen as simpler way of getting cover. Better candidates also
realised that simplified underwriting is unlikely to have a lot of complicated special terms
associated with it.
Part (iii) was also well answered, with most candidates correctly identifying marketability and
costs as major considerations.
In part (iv) many candidates did not generate enough ideas and missed some easy marks as a
result.

## QUESTION 3

i.
Possible reasons for the higher than anticipated incidence rates:
• The pricing basis may have been based on incorrect data. The company may have
had little data for pricing during those years, and therefore failed to account
properly for claims incidence.
• The company may have modelled critical incidence claims incidence incorrectly.
For example, interactions between risk events may have been modelled incorrectly.
Given that these products were new at the time, and Dreadsure may have had no
experience in pricing the product.
• The policy definitions may have been too loose and inconsistent with what was
assumed when pricing. Resulting in more claims than expected due to court
decisions in favour of the policyholder
• The underwriting process may have failed to properly control the risk being
brought onto the books during the early stages of offering the product. Exposing
the insurer to anti-selection.
• Advances in medical technology may have improved the identification and
diagnosis of critical illnesses. This means that more cases are diagnosed prior to
patients’ death – leading to more claims.
• The claims verification process may have been too weak resulting in acceptance of
fraudulent or exaggerated claims.
ii.
Claims incidence per stage = Cancer diagnosis rate × (1 – 30-day mortality rate)
Claim incidence rate for Stage 1 cancer
= 0.0006(1 - 0.002)
= 0.0005988
Total claim incidence rate
= 0.0006(1 - 0.002) + 0.0002(1 - 0.05)
= 0.0007888
Hence, the proportion of claims relating to Stage 1 cancer
= 0.0005988/0.0007888
= 0.759

iii.
Possible impact:
• There will be a change in the cancer claim inception rate.
• The rate would be expected to fall significantly.
• However, the reduction will not be of the order of 75% (as calculated above) as
many of the Stage 1 claims which will be excluded may arrive as Stage 2 claims
in the future.
• The move will most likely result in the dissatisfaction of current policyholders.
• Policyholders many challenge the review of benefits and may claim that they
were not informed about the reviewable contract clause or they had been told
such reviews would only be to enhance benefits.
• The regulator may be concerned about the fair treatment of customers implication
of the change.
• Particularly if the benefits are reduced and pricing of the product remains
unchanged.
• Lapses on existing business are likely to increase, depend on how aware and
responsive policyholders are to the changes.
(cid:1) It is likely that policyholders managed by brokers will be the most likely to
lapse, while direct marketing policyholders are the least likely to lapse.
(cid:1) Lapses are likely to be selective, with those in worst health (who may not get
cover elsewhere) remaining, resulting in worsening of claims experience.
• This may be unpopular with the distribution channel(s).
• The product may become less competitive compared to other products in the
market.
• This will damage new business being written.
• It is likely to damage Dreadsure’s reputation in the market, particularly if this is
not something being done by other insurers in the market.
• It may cause Dreadsure to lose new business on its other products.
Examiners’ comments:
In part (i) many candidates failed to give a sufficiently detailed explanation for the suggested
reasons for higher than anticipated incident rates.
In part (ii) a disappointing number of candidates failed to take the survival period or Stage 2
cancer incidence rates into account correctly in their calculations.
For part (iii) weaker candidates failed to give a wide enough range of points relating to the
implications around fair treatment of customers and the reputation of the insurer in the event
of the change to the policy conditions.

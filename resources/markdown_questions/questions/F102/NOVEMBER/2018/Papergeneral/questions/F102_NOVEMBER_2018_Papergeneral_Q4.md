## QUESTION 4

(i)
The insurer could use actuarial funding.
For the unit-linked contract the full value of the unit fund will only be required when certain
contingent events occur e.g. when the policyholder dies, the insurer can therefore hold the
actuarial present value of the unit fund rather than its fully funded value.
The fund management charge therefore needs to be greater than that necessary to cover the
actual fund management expenses.
The insurer initially holds fewer units in the fund than would be expected to be bought for the
given amount of premium.
The insurer buys back the “missing” units over time using the fund management charges.
The insurer could use negative non-unit reserves.
This method can be used provided it is permitted by the insurance regulatory regime.
The non-unit reserve will be negative if the expected present value of the charges (unallocated
premium, risk charges and annual fund management charge) is greater than the expected present
value of the outgo in the form of mortality benefits and expenses.
(ii)
Determine a suitable period of data for the experience investigate, balance relevance with
sufficiency of data.
Divide the data into homogenous groups, using the following factors: type of product, duration
in force, sales channel, age and gender of policyholder, premium/ sum assured.
Ensure that there is sufficient data in each group for analysis to be credible.
For the first year persistency rate: divide policies that survive to end of first year by the exposure
for contracts issued in the year rate (excluding deaths and maturities). Follow similar process
for year 2 etc.
Investigate any trends or unusual values in the data.

(iii)
Possible reasons:
• Losses due to higher than expected mortality than allowed for the pricing of either or
both contracts.
• Higher than expected expenses.
• Higher expense inflation than allowed for in loadings for expenses / charges for either
or both contracts
• Fall in fund values for unit linked contract resulting in lower fund management charges
than required for on-going expenses.
• Losses due to adverse movements in investment values for assets backing the index-
linked contracts, to the extent that assets are not an exact match to the index.
• Lower business volumes leading to lower contributions to fixed expenses
• Different business mix than expected leading to losses from cross-subsidies assumed
in the pricing
• High sales resulting in capital strain on the insurer.
• Increased competition in the market.
• Higher than expected withdrawals at early policy durations (when the asset share is
negative).
Examiners’ comments:
Part (i) was bookwork and relatively well answered. A few candidates failed to identify negative
reserving as a second reserving method to reduce new business strain.
For part (ii) and (iii) better candidates gave a comprehensive explanation of the process for
setting lapse rates and a wide range of possible reasons for the loss making business.

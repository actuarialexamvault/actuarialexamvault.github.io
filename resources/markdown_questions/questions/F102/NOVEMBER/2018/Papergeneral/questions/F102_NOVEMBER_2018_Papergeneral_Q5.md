## QUESTION 5

i.
The insurer will determine cash bonuses as follows:
• The insurer will sub-divide the book of with-profits policies into homogenous
groups with similar features.
• It will then assess the actual experience of each group of policies and compare that
to the expected experience.
• This will identify what the sources of surplus were for each group of policies, and
allow the insurer to attribute mortality, investment and expense profits directly to
the groups of policies on which they arise.
• In determining a final dividend for each group of policies, the insurer may decide
to retain some profit for smoothing purposes or to improve the solvency position.
• The cash dividend will then be distributed separately to each group of policies
according to the following formula:
Cash dividend = (V + P)(i” – i) + (q – q’)(S – V ) + E(1 + i) – E”(1 + i”)
0 1
Where:
V is the value of the policy at the beginning of the year on the valuation
basis
V is the value of the policy at the end of the year on the valuation basis
P is the gross premium of the policy
i is the (expected) valuation basis rate of interest
i” is the actual rate of interest earned over the year on the group of policies
q is the (expected) valuation basis mortality rate
q’ is the actual mortality rate experienced by the group of policies
S is the policy sum assured
E is the (expected) valuation basis expenses
E” is the actual expenses experienced under the group of policies

ii.
The change in approach will have to be carefully considered in the light of contractual
obligations towards existing policyholders.
Possible advantages:
• The use of terminal bonuses, as opposed to fully distributing all surplus each year
through a cash dividend, will improve the solvency position of the insurer.
• It may also assist the insurer in following a less constrained investment policy,
which may improve returns under these policies.
• The insurer will be able to enhance the smoothing of bonuses, which may better fit
the needs of some policyholders.
• Bonuses will now relate more directly to benefits and clients may feel that they
better understand what to expect from policy benefits.
• The change in approach may make the policies and their benefits more comparable
with competitor products.
• Policyholders may be trying to save for a specific goal and bonuses that accumulate
to maturity (as opposed to paying out in cash each year) may suit their objective
better.
• Reversionary bonus levels and ultimately maturity benefits may seem bigger to
policyholders in relation to the cash bonuses that can be afforded for a similar
premium and experience under both approaches, which may help to enhance new
business volumes.
• The new approach may be simpler and less costly to administer.
Possible disadvantages:
• The change will defer the sharing of bonuses with a policyholder, which may be
perceived as less favourable for policyholders than the previous practice.
• Policyholders may not value the increased death cover benefits and may have
purchased these policies specifically for the annual cash dividend and may now not
be able to meet their objectives.
• Policyholders may feel that the new approach is less fair than the current method.
• It is a material change in approach and existing policyholders may feel that their
reasonable expectations are not being met.
• For this reason the insurer may have to apply the change in approach only to new
policies from a certain date and continue existing policies under the old approach.
• As a mutual insurer, under the new approach, the insurer will lose its ability to pay
an annual dividend to policyholders and may lose favour with potential customers
when compared to proprietary insurance company competitors.
• There may be large expenses associated with the required system changes and
client communication.

iii.
It may face the following challenges:
• Bonus declarations will have to be reasonable given policyholder reasonable
expectations created through policy contracts and marketing material.
• Policyholders will expect real returns under these policies, which are normally
obtained through investments in equity and property. Given the recent investment
performance of these two asset classes, it may be a challenge to obtain real returns
over certain durations.
• Given the volatility of returns from equity and property, it will be a challenge to
smooth bonuses, especially annual reversionary bonuses.
• It may be difficult to initially determine a suitable bonus level and the sustainability
of reversionary bonus rates may come under pressure.
• Under these conditions, the insurer may want to make more use of terminal
bonuses, which will make final policy benefits less certain for policyholders.
• This may lead to reduced new business volumes compared to competitors that
provide more guaranteed type savings products.
• Terminal bonuses may even need to be negative in some cases.
• The volatility of returns will cause large fluctuations in the earned asset shares of
these policies from one year to the next. This will lead to increased capital
requirements, making these policies either less profitable to the insurer or providing
less value for money to the policyholder.
• Policyholder confidence in the product may fall, leading to higher withdrawal rates.
• The policyholders may perceive surre nder values to be unfair or too volatile.
• The insurer will be new to managing reversionary and terminal bonus rates under
the new methodology, which may lead to it making mistakes with bonus
declarations. This will either cost the company money or lead to potential client
losses.
Examiners’ comments:
Part (i) was bookwork, but was poorly answered by most candidates. Many candidates simply
provided the formula and did not state the obvious/easy process points related to subdividing
policies into homogenous groups, comparing actual to expected experience and attributing
mortality, investment and expense surplus to the policies on which they arise, or holding back
a portion of the surplus to aid smoothing.
Part (ii) was largely application of bookwork, but was still answered less comprehensively
than expected by most candidates, indicating a lack of preparation or understanding of the
impact.
Part (iii) was a more advanced application question, with most candidates struggling to
produce a comprehensive answer.

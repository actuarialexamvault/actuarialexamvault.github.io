## QUESTION 6

i.
A passive valuation approach is one which uses a valuation methodology which is relatively
insensitive to changes in market conditions and a valuation basis which is updated relatively
infrequently.
The advantages of the passive approach are that:
• it is straightforward to implement;
• involves less subjectivity; and
• will result in stable profit release.
An active approach is more closely aligned to market conditions with assumptions being
updated on a more frequent basis.
The advantages of the active approach are that:
• it provides management with a more relevant and up-to-date balance sheet allowing
more informed decision making; and
• it enables management to take necessary corrective action earlier than if a passive
approach was used thus reducing the risk of insolvency.
ii.
The impact on the solvency of the business is dependent on the net impact of the release of
prudential margins and addition of risk margins and the impact of the move to a zero-coupon
risk free bond curve instead of discounting using a 10 year point on the government bond curve.
The move from prudential margins to a best estimate basis will result in a reduction in the
policyholder liabilities for the whole life cover product.
The policyholder liabilities will be increased by the inclusion of risk margins which allows for
the cost of capital of the product.
The financial implications of the move to a zero-coupon risk-free bond curve will depend on
the term of the remaining cashflows on the in-force book and the shape of the zero-coupon risk
free bond curve.
If most of the cashflows are concentrated in the term less/more than 10 years and the zero-
coupon risk free bond curve is upward sloping, the value of the liability will increase/decrease.
If most of the cashflows are concentrated in the term less/more than 10 years and the zero-
coupon risk free bond curve is downward sloping, he value of the liability will
decrease/increase.

iii.
a.
The policyholder liabilities for the conventional life annuities will increase for the lower
mortality and increased longevity assumption.
The whole life cover policyholder liabilities will reduce for the impact of the lower mortality.
The capital requirement and risk margin for the conventional life annuities will likely increase
if the stress to determine the capital requirement is a proportion of the mortality and longevity
improvement assumption, whereas the capital requirement and risk margin for the whole life
cover products will likely decrease if the mortality stress is a proportion of the mortality
assumption.
b.
The increase in yields will reduce the policyholder liabilities for all three products.
The capital requirement will reduce due to the impact of the higher discount rate on the stressed
cashflows.
Particularly for the whole of life product and conventional life annuities which have long
durations.
Consequently the risk margin should reduce for the products, in particular for the whole life
cover and conventional life annuities.
c)
The use of the illiquidity premium for the 5-year investment product results in an increase in
the yield for discounting the policyholder liabilities for this product.
The size of the policyholder liabilities will consequently reduce.
The capital requirement may increase if the regulator requires capital to be held for the risk that
the illiquidity premium assumption is incorrect.
As the 5-year investment product does not have many uncertain assumptions, the risk margin
is expected to be small (potentially a risk margin for expense risk). There is therefore likely to
be minimal impact on the size of the risk margin.
The risk margin may increase marginally if capital is held to support risk of the illiquidity
premium not materialising.
Examiners’ comments:
Part (i) was a bookwork question and most candidates performed well.
Part (ii) was poorly answered. Many candidates identified the changes that would arise from
the margins, however, few candidates identified that a market consistent approach should use
a full yield curve rather than a single point on the curve.
Part (iii) was fairly well answered with candidates identifying a number of the impacts
correctly. Some candidates struggled with the understanding of the difference between impacts
on the liability and impacts on the capital requirement.

## QUESTION 7

i.
The liability characteristics and the most suitable matching assets:
• Income Protection (IP) pays a regular income, usually to retirement age, to an
insured who becomes unable to work due to illness or accident.
• The term of the liabilities depends on the policyholder age profile. It is likely to be
medium- to long-term (e.g. up to 30 years for a young insured).
There is unlikely to be a surrender value on without-profits IP (which would have
reduced the term of the liabilities).
• The nature of the benefit (and hence matching assets) depends on the policy
conditions. Benefits can either be fixed (level or fixed increase) or linked to an
index (prices or wages).
• Fixed benefits are best matched by:
(cid:1) fixed interest stocks of suitable term, probably government-issued;
(cid:1) corporate issued stocks can increase the expected return through the liquidity
premium if stocks can be held to maturity, however the extent to which credit
risk can be accepted depends on a number of factors e.g. solvency level and
risk tolerance.
• Index-linked benefits (linked to price inflation) are best matched by CPI-linked
bonds.
• Index-linked benefits (linked to wage inflation) are best matched by a basket of
high-quality real-return assets e.g. property and equities. However, there is a risk
of needing to sell assets at inopportune times due to short-term asset volatility.
• The extent of index linkage may differ for benefits out of claim and within claim,
and the asset mix must reflect this.
• The nature of the insurance company’s expenses are likely to be real (linked to
wages) due to staff costs.
• Hence real type assets (index-linked bonds, property and equity) are suitable.
• The currency of the liabilities depends on policy conditions. Policies usually pay
IP benefits in a foreign country if the insured is working in that country at the time
of claim event.
• The insurer should invest in the same currency as the liabilities for a matched
position.
• The variability of experience depends on target market, location and policy
conditions, which can make the experience uncertain and variable.
• This requires assets to be more liquid and less volatile than for more stable and
predictable life products.

ii.
The cause(s) of the reducing solvency level should be investigated:
• One (and possibly the main) cause will be new business strain from strong sales
growth. Changing investment strategy in this case is not likely to have much
impact, and at best might only delay insolvency.
(cid:1) The insurer may need to find alternative sources of capital or alternatively
reduce sales growth and/or sell a less capital-intensive product.
• The uncertainties and guarantees of a without-profits IP product are likely to result
in relatively high capital requirements.
(cid:1) Reducing the level of guarantees e.g. making the premiums reviewable, may
help reduce new business strain.
• The insurer should satisfy itself that the expected deterioration in the solvency
position is not due to an inadequately priced product (and that strong sales growth
may be due to this) leading to projected losses.
• Expense inefficiencies might contribute to the reducing solvency level, and
changing investments may not have enough impact to offset this.
The director is correct in that property and equity returns are normally expected to be higher
than other asset classes,
However the suggestion may have limited effect:
• If the benefits are index-linked (in particular to wages), the asset mix may already
include property and equities as matching assets.
• While these asset classes may be expected to produce higher returns than other
assets, they can also experience higher short-term volatility.
• This volatility may require higher capital requirements may lead to a higher chance
of insolvency.
Other issues to consider
• Rental income from property may provide regular cashflows to support regular
income protection benefit payments, but cashflows from equities may not provide
a suitable match.
• Property and equity are not a suitable match for short-dated liabilities or for fixed
liabilities – this increases the liquidity risk of the insurer.
• The mismatch created increases insolvency risk and is likely to lead to higher
capital requirements.
• The insurer will need to hold a minimum level of liquid money market investments
as working capital and to meet short-term claims and expenses.
• Direct property investment is very illiquid and only the largest insurance
companies could achieve acceptable diversification, and hence indirect investment
is likely to be more suitable.
• A large-scale sale and reinvestment of the assets currently held will incur
significant trading costs and other costs (e.g. unfavourable price changes due to the
insurer’s switch, taxes) and these costs might outweigh the benefits.

iii.
If the director’s intention is to increase mismatch risk in order to maximise shareholder returns,
then this might be acceptable provided:
• Higher mismatch reserves or capital requirements resulting from higher risk
investments do not negate the benefit of higher returns from property and equity.
• The increased probability of insolvency due to a resulting mismatch is within the
company’s risk tolerance.
If the intention is to increase free reserves over time, the company should consider other aspects
of the business as well as investments, namely sales and distribution strategy, product strategy,
reinsurance strategy and expense management.
But although the holdings in equity and property may be increased it is likely that the insurer
will continue to hold other asset classes.
Examiners ‘comments:
For part (i) better candidates identified the various possible benefit structures (fixed,
increasing with price inflation and increasing with salary inflation) and identified possible
matching assets. Many candidates discussed factors to consider when setting an investment
strategy that were not relevant to matching assets.
For part (ii) many candidates failed to consider possible reasons for the reducing free asset
position and alternative responses to addressing this risk. Many candidates failed to give a
sufficient range of points in their justification of the response to the director’s suggestion.
Part (iii) was poorly answered, candidates who scored better demonstrated how their response
and justification of the response would differ from part (ii).

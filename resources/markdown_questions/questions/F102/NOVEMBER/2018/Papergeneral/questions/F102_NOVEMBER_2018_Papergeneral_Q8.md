## QUESTION 8

i.
Embedded value is calculated as the sum of:
• The shareholder-owned share of net assets, where net assets are defined as the excess
of assets held over those required to meet liabilities.
• The discounted value of future shareholder profits arising on existing business; often
referred to as ‘present value of future profits’.
ii.
Net asset value:
• The assets may be valued at market value or may be discounted to reflect ‘lock-in’ to
the extent that assets backing solvency capital requirements are invested more
cautiously and as a result are expected to earn a lower return.
• The insurance liabilities are valued on the supervisory basis.
The future cashflows on the existing business are projected on the embedded value basis and
are used to estimate the future shareholder profit.
These cashflows include future premiums, investment income, claims and expenses, plus the
release of supervisory reserves.
The cashflows are discounted at an appropriate risk discount rate to determine the present value
of future profits (PVFP).
The risk discount rate incorporates a risk margin for unpredictability in the emergence of profit.
The PVFP is effectively the release of any margins within the supervisory reserves relative to
the embedded value basis used.
The embedded value basis is usually a realistic basis.
The insurance liabilities used in the calculation of the present value of future profits are
consistent with the insurance liabilities in the calculation of the net asset value i.e. the projected
future liabilities are on the supervisory basis.
Tax on profits and investment returns is allowed for, as appropriate.
iii.
Moving from a prudent to a best-estimate basis for determining supervisory reserves will result
in a release of reserves at the point in time that the basis changes which will increase the net
asset value.
As reserves have reduced the release of reserves over the policy lifetime will be reduced
reducing the level of the present value of expected future profits.
The impact of any possible increase in the solvency capital requirement due to the move to a
risk-based approach may have the effect of reducing the embedded value if assets are
discounted to reflect ‘lock in’ of assets to support the solvency requirements that are expected
to be invested more conservatively.
Examiners’ comments:
Part (i) was pure book work. Many students correctly identified the two components, but lost
marks by failing to indicate “shareholder’s portion of” in one or both of the components.
Part (ii) was again bookwork or the application thereof, but the question was answered less
comprehensively than expected. Many students missed marks by not describing the basis for
valuing assets, or by getting confused with a market consistent valuation method. Most students

were able to list the basic steps of projecting the cashflows, listing the cashflow components
and discounting the cashflows at an appropriate rate, but missed the points on the valuation
bases applicable to the cashflow components and the reserves.
For Part (iii), most students identified the impact on the NAV, but missed the reduction in the
release of reserves component.

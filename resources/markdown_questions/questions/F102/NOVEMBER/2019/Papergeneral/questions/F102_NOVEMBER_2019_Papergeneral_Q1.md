## QUESTION 1

i. The results may be used for:
• Updating the pricing basis
• Revising product design, for example setting discontinuance terms
• Changing the product mix/ launching new products
• Revising the underwriting process
• Implementing or improving retention activity
• Changing the marketing message, target market and/or distribution channel
• Revising sales procedure in terms of training and selection of distributors,
wording and format of sales literature
• Revising the mechanics of any commission payments and clawbacks
• Improving the wording of policy contracts
• Improving the adequacy of staffing resources to better carry out policy
administration
• Improving actuarial models
• Updating the reserving basis
• Improving risk management governance and controls
• Determining the asset shares of remaining policies
• Model office work, for example monitoring profitability, embedded values,
projections, asset-liability management, bonus distributions etc.
• Amending premium collection methods
ii. Analysis of persistency:
• The process would begin with collecting the data across all policies that did not
end due to death or maturity.
• Data will be collected for more than the five years under analysis, and should be
collected over a period which is long enough to ensure that the data is credible
while remaining relevant.
• Data collected will then need to be split or analysed as follows:
(cid:1) By type of contract, particularly given that the insurers sells both protection
and savings products.
(cid:1) The policies will also need to be analysed in terms of duration in force.
(cid:1) Sales method and target market should be considered.
(cid:1) This is particularly important given that the insurer sells to both individuals
and employer groups – which are likely to have different persistency
characteristics.
(cid:1) Other factors such as the premium payment method, frequency of premium
payment, premium/benefit size, results of initial underwriting, original term
of the contract or demographics could be considered.
• The data cells used must retain their credibility, while displaying homogeneity
within each cell.

• The first year withdrawal rates will be calculated by taking the number of policies
that withdrew within their first policy year across the time period, and dividing by
the number of policies issued during the time period under analysis.
• The second and subsequent year withdrawal rates will be calculated accordingly
by considering the number of policies that withdrew during the considered year
divided by the number in force at the start of the considered year.
• It will be useful to consider the withdrawal rates for each product before and after
the introduction of the endowment assurance.
(cid:1) The reduced persistency may be due to the new product cannibalising market
share from the insurer’s other products.
• The persistency analysis must also take into account any changes in the
competitive and economic landscape within which the insurer operates in order to
understand the observed trends.
Part (i) was bookwork and generally well answered by most candidates. Some candidates
gave high level general comments such as “providing management information” or
“identifying trends” which did not earn credit.
Part (ii) was fairly well answered by most candidates, although many candidates focussed
only on the last 5 years’ experience data, thereby missing out on the opportunity to compare
the experience of the other products before and after launch of the endowment assurance.

## QUESTION 2

i. The following product features would need to be specified in the design of the product:
• Nature of benefit payments: Level, increasing at a fixed rate, increasing in line
with an index or some combination thereof.
• Death benefits or guarantees: For example, first 60 months payments are
guaranteed.
• Spouse’s reversion: Percentage of benefit amount, number of spouses covered
(unlikely to offer this as a default option).
• Any enhancement for impaired mortality.
• Maximum age.
• Expense charge design.
ii. Lower than expected premium income may be due to:
• Lower than anticipated capital value of pension at the point of purchase if:
(cid:1) Tax at retirement is higher than anticipated.
(cid:1) Deductions from fund values at retirement exist, for example to settle a
housing debt or a divorce settlement.
(cid:1) Investment returns have been lower than anticipated prior to retirement (in
the defined contribution context).
• Contributions to pension schemes may be lower than expected.
• More pension scheme members take the maximum amount in cash permitted by
regulations than expected.
• Low take up of the default option because pension scheme members elect to
purchase open-market annuities:
(cid:1) Particularly members who have their own brokers and members who want a
different design feature of the annuity (for example increasing vs level
benefit payments).
(cid:1) Default annuities are a new feature so more marketing may be required.
(cid:1) Members may get better rates elsewhere.
iii. Effect of premium volumes being different than expected:
• If premium volumes are lower than expected:
(cid:1) Profits may be lower than anticipated.
(cid:1) Fixed expenses and development costs may not be covered.
(cid:1) Percentage of premium charges may be inadequate.
(cid:1) Investment freedom may be reduced.
• If premium volumes are higher than expected:
(cid:1) The company may experience capital strain depending on how onerous
solvency requirements for this type of business are.
(cid:1) There may be pressure on administration systems and servicing of customers
may be compromised.

iv. Other risks relating to the product:
Mortality and longevity:
• Mortality may be lighter than anticipated.
• This may arise due to over-estimation of base mortality or under-estimation of
mortality improvements.
• The company may have little previous experience of mortality for this target
market.
• Longevity risk is exacerbated by the risk of anti-selection, if members in poor
health elect income draw down products.
• Guaranteed death benefits expose the insurer to the risk of higher mortality early
in the policy term.
Source of business:
• There is going to be a concentration by source as one would anticipate a large
number of policies arising from each pension scheme.
• There may be some correlations between policyholders in terms of annuity
amount and mortality early in the term. Although this is only really a downside
risk if there are guarantees.
Investment returns:
• Assets that match the liability may not be available, particularly if the discounted
mean term is long.
• Matching assets may not be available for the benefit increase structure of the
insurer.
• If following an unmatched strategy, the insurer is exposed to:
(cid:1) Reinvestment risk;
(cid:1) Risk that investment returns are lower than anticipated; and
(cid:1) Movements in assets that may create solvency difficulties.
Expenses:
• Base expenses may be higher than anticipated.
• Expense inflation may be higher than anticipated.
Business volumes for other business:
• Business volumes on other annuity and income draw down products may be
reduced.
• Particularly if brokers are angered by the introduction of a no commission
product and recommend products from other insurers to customers.
Competitive pressures:
• Competitive pressures to acquire the business from pension funds may encourage
the insurer to reduce premium rates; or
• Offer additional guarantees on the product increasing the risks relating to the
product.

Reinsurance/risk transfer:
• Reinsurance may not be appropriate to manage the risks.
• Longevity swap may be the preferred risk transfer measure, but may not be
available.
• Reinsurer may default on its obligations.
Reputational risk if product does not meet the expectations of policyholders:
• No advice is given at the sales stage of this product, so members may
misunderstand the terms and conditions of the policy.
• Policyholders may select high cash lump sums resulting in low annuity payments
and hence the product failing to meet their expectations.
• Inflation may erode purchasing power, resulting in reputational risk (even for an
inflation-linked which typically increases annually).
Fraud:
• Families may claim the pension benefit after the pensioner has died.
Regulation:
• Regulation may permit entities other than life insurers to compete for example
pension schemes and may result in regulatory arbitrage.
This question required candidates to read the question carefully and plan the answers for all
four parts. The reference to “other” risks in part (iv) would have indicated this. It was clear
that many candidates did not plan their answers and needlessly lost marks for answering one
part of the question in the wrong sub-section. Many candidates did not seem to understand
what a product feature is and others lost marks through only answering half of part (iii).
Candidates are reminded that question wording is very deliberate and they must answer the
question that is asked, not the one they think should follow logically. A disturbing number of
candidates showed a complete lack of understanding of single premium products generally,
annuities in particular and how a compulsory purchase annuity would work specifically.

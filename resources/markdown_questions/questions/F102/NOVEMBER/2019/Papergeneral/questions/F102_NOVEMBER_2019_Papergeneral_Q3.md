## QUESTION 3

i. The reserve will be made up of two elements, a unit reserve and a non-unit reserve.
Unit reserve:
• The unit reserve would be equal to the value of the units held on the valuation
date, calculated by multiplying the number of units held by the bid price of a unit
on that date.
• This would ensure that, for a contract maturing on the valuation date, a unit
reserve is being held sufficient to cover the maturity benefit.
Non-unit reserve:
• A non-unit reserve is necessary if expenses are likely to exceed charges at any
future time.
• A non-unit reserve is also necessary because there is a minimum guaranteed
death benefit, of a fixed amount, that may exceed the bid value of the units.
(cid:1) This is particularly so at early durations when the guaranteed death benefit is
likely to be significantly higher than the bid value of the units.
• The non-unit reserve would be calculated by determining all the non-unit cash
flows arising under each contract, allowing for decrements. These cashflows
include:
(cid:1) Unallocated premiums, mortality charges and any other charges received (for
example annual management charge, bid/offer spreads etc.)
(cid:1) Expected renewal and claims expenses
(cid:1) Expected death benefits
(cid:1) Any profits/losses on surrender or part-surrender
• Projected cashflows will most likely be discounted at the risk-free rate.
• If the discounted value of the projected net cashflows is negative the regulator
may require the insurer to zeroise (set the present value equal to zero) on a per
policy basis or on a portfolio basis.
ii. Suggested approach for reserving for the investment guarantee:
• A stochastic model would be the preferred approach to determine the reserve for
any shortfalls in the value of the unit fund relative to the guaranteed minimum
maturity value.
Reasons why a deterministic model would be inappropriate:
• Under a deterministic model the future value of the fund may be projected using
the expected level of investment returns less charges based on the expected asset
allocation for the investment fund.
• The fund value projected on this basis is likely to exceed the minimum
guaranteed value at maturity, resulting in a zero reserve for the investment
guarantee.
• Although a few investment outcome scenarios can be tested using a deterministic
model, the scenarios selected are subjective and it is difficult to assign a
probability to them, in addition this type of model is unlikely to give a sufficient

range of investment outcomes to determine the reserve for an investment
guarantee.
Use of a stochastic model will produce a range of outcomes of fund values based on the
simulated investment returns, a number of these outcomes will reflect a shortfall in the
unit fund compared to the guaranteed minimum maturity value.
Use of a stochastic model in this regard could follow the approach outlined below:
• A stochastic model would project the unit fund using many different simulated
investment scenarios, where the future investment returns are governed by a
probability distribution function.
• The assumptions underlying the model should reflect the investment strategy of
the unit fund.
• The shortfall relating to the investment guarantee (i.e. where the fund value lower
than the guaranteed minimum payment at maturity) will be determined for each
investment scenario.
• The projected future shortfall may be reduced by the projected value of future
charges on the unit fund relating to the investment guarantee.
• The present value of the shortfall can be determined by discounting the projected
shortfalls at a suitable discount rate.
• The probability of the policy maturing should be taken into account through
relevant decrements (for example mortality and withdrawals).
• Repeated simulation (1000s of simulations) will generate the probability
distribution of outcomes for the reserves for the investment guarantee.
• The reserve for the investment guarantee could be set as the expected (i.e.
average) present value of the simulated outcomes.
• If more prudence is required at point on the distribution of outcomes representing
the regulator’s risk tolerance for example 75% level could be chosen.
• Care should be taken in the level of confidence placed on the results as they are
sensitive to distribution and the calibration of the parameters for the investment
returns.
(cid:1) Since this is a developing country there may not be sufficient data available
to calibrate the model with confidence.
This question was relatively poorly answered. In general candidates structured their answers
poorly and failed to focus their answers on the key aspects of the question. This resulted in
wasted time on unnecessary points and missing important points.
For part (i) stronger candidates explained the method for reserving for both the unit fund and
non-unit fund in a methodical manner, while weaker candidates discussed reserving in
general. A number of candidates wasted time by giving too much detail on general issues for
reserving.
In part (ii) the majority of candidates failed to give sufficient detail in explaining the method
stochastic modelling.

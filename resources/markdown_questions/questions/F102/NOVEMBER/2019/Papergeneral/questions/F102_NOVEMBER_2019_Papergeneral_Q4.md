## QUESTION 4

i. The approach for determining surrender values should take the following principles into
account:
• For both methods, whether the principle that the surrender value should take
policyholder reasonable expectations into account is met depends on whether the
calculated surrender values are consistent with the information provided to
customers at the sales stage.
• Both methods are likely to meet this principle that the surrender value should not
appear too low compared to premiums paid at early durations by definition of the
surrender value.
• Traditional products are unlikely to meet the principle that the surrender value
should be consistent with projected maturity values at later durations.
(cid:1) The guaranteed maturity value is should be higher than premiums paid as it
takes investment earnings over the term of the policy into account.
• New-generation products are likely to meet the principle above as the prospective
surrender value is likely to progress smoothly towards the maturity value over
time.
• Traditional products are unlikely to meet the principle that the surrender value
should not exceed the earned asset share in aggregate, over a reasonable period.
(cid:1) As, the surrender value is likely to be higher than the asset share at early
durations and lower at later durations in the policy term.
• New-generation products are likely to meet the principle above as the prospective
method is likely to be lower than the earned asset share.
• The traditional products do not meet the principle that the surrender value should
produce a reasonable contribution to profit of the insurer and maintain equity
with continuing policyholders and shareholders.
(cid:1) There will be losses at early durations and excessive profits at later durations.
• Whether above principle is met for new-generation products depends on whether
the basis used for the prospective method allows the insurer to recover the losses
at early durations and produce a profit that is not excessive after the second
policy anniversary.
• Traditional products are unlikely to meet the principle that the surrender value
should avoid selection against the insurer.
(cid:1) As early surrenders are encouraged and later surrenders are discouraged.
• For new-generation products surrenders prior to the second policy anniversary
may be encouraged, but the effect may be less severe than for the traditional
products.
• Surrender values for traditional products are not consistent with those for new-
generation products, thus do not take the approach taken by all competitors into
account.
• Consistency of surrender values across new-generation products depends on the
basis used for the prospective method.
• Traditional products are likely to meet the principle that the surrender value
should avoid discontinuities by duration.

• New-generation products are unlikely to meet this principle as there is likely to be
a discontinuity at the second policy anniversary where the method changes.
• Both methods are likely to meet the objective that the surrender value should not
be subject to frequent change, unless the basis for the prospective method is
changed frequently.
• Both methods are likely to meet the objective that the surrender value should not
be excessively complicated to calculate, unless the basis is complicated for the
prospective calculation for the new-generation products.
• Both methods are likely to meet this principle that the surrender value should be
capable of being clearly documented.
ii. Profit arising for each of the bases under consideration for the prospective method of
determining surrender values:
• The total profit retained by the insurer is the excess of the earned asset share over
the surrender value paid (EAS – SV)
• This can be separated into two parts: the profit earned to date (EAS – SV(p)), and
the capitalised value of the profit that will arise in the future due to differences
between the original premium rate assumptions and the surrender value
assumptions (SV(p) – SV), where SV(p) is the prospective surrender value on the
original premium basis.
• At early durations there will be a loss on surrender where the asset share is lower
than the premiums paid to date or the prospective surrender value.
• After early durations the profit earned to date is the difference between actual
experience and that assumed in the original premium basis.
• The value for capitalised future profits will be:
(cid:1) zero if the original premium basis is used for determining the surrender value;
and
(cid:1) equal to the expected future profits as if the policy had not been surrendered,
if the best estimate of future experience is used.
• Depending on how the expenses relating to the policy surrender are allowed for in
the charge for the surrender, these expenses may reduce the profit.
Part (i) was poorly answered by many candidates. The question related to a relatively
straightforward application of the bookwork on surrender value principles to two example
products. Candidates who approached the question in a systematic way and explained the
extent to which each product meets each of the surrender principles scored well, with some
even able to earn full marks for the question. A very large number of candidates however
merely stated the theory, with little reference to the question and no substantive explanation
of how each product meets each of the surrender value principles, and consequently were not
able to score very well.
Part (ii) was bookwork, but answers were largely a “hit-or-miss”, with candidates either
getting close to full marks or close to zero. Those candidates that took a structured approach
to work through each of the components of profit at the point of surrender scored well.

## QUESTION 6

i. Liability characteristics and matching assets:
• The insurer would look to match assets and liabilities as closely as possible. The
extent to which the insurer will deviate from this fully matched approach will
depend on its risk appetite and free capital.
• The nature of the benefits is without-profit, and this is best matched by fixed
interest stocks.
• Fixed interest stock issued by government should be risk free.
• Corporate bonds might be considered if the insurer is willing to accept (and hold
capital for) default and illiquidity risk in order to enhance returns.
• If the benefits for any of the products are linked to an index (for example index-
linked immediate annuity) then these liabilities are best matched by index-linked
bonds.
• The term of suitable fixed interest stocks depends on the outstanding term of
policies and annuities issued by the insurer:
(cid:1) Term assurance policies may have terms of less than 10 years.
(cid:1) Immediate life annuities and whole of life policies are likely to have terms
greater than 10 years.
• Future insurer expenses are likely to be inflation-linked, and these are best
matched by index-linked bonds of suitable terms or a mix of real assets that
includes a limited exposure to equities.
• Currency is likely to be local, and hence assets need to be of the same currency.
• Shorter-term liabilities (of less than one year) and working capital are best
matched by money market stocks:
(cid:1) Money market stocks are highly liquid in nature, have stable capital values
and are hence a good match for short-term liabilities.
• In practice it might not be possible to find fixed interest stocks of long enough
term for the annuities:
(cid:1) The insurer will then need to consider whether to accept (and hold capital) for
the term mismatch or find alternative investments (for example, foreign
bonds of long duration with a currency hedge).
iii. Director’s proposal:
• Despite yielding negative returns, there is merit in using bonds to match without-
profit liabilities:
(cid:1) Returns are fixed in monetary terms and the insurer is reducing the risk of
insolvency and not meeting benefits by matching appropriately.
• Current bonds held by the insurer may have been purchased at higher yields to
maturity:
(cid:1) Selling these now could trigger capital gains taxes that would be avoided by
holding the bonds to maturity;
(cid:1) There may be significant other transaction costs in selling existing assets and
purchasing equities.

• Negative nominal yields do not imply that real yields will be negative as investors
might be anticipating a period of deflation.
• The proposal is to significantly mismatch by nature, and the extent to which this
can be done depends on:
(cid:1) The insurer’s solvency level and risk appetite.
(cid:1) Regulation.
• There is no guarantee that returns can be improved by investing in equities:
(cid:1) Equity returns, even over long periods, can be highly uncertain and risky.
(cid:1) Low bond returns may signal investor concern for other assets (such as
equities).
(cid:1) The risk of insolvency is likely to be too high.
Part (i) was bookwork and answered well by most candidates. Candidates, who scored
poorly, spent too much time detailing the nature of the liabilities as opposed to the assets.
Part (ii) was poorly answered by most candidates. It was evident that many candidates did
not understand the meaning or implications of “negative yields”.

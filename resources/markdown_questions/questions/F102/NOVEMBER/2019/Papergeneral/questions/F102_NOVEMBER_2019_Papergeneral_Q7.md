## QUESTION 7

i. Medical conditions are likely to include:
• Cancer
• Coronary artery by-pass surgery/graft
• Heart attack
• Kidney failure
• Major organ transplant
• Multiple sclerosis
• Stroke
ii. Needs of the new target market:
• To some extent the new target market will have similar needs for insurance to the
existing target market.
(cid:1) For example, funding the cost of a change in life style or specialist medical
equipment following a severe medical event or paying off a mortgage or
student loan.
• However, they are less likely to have as significant needs to provide cover for
their dependants, than the existing target market.
• The new target market is younger, and on average will have less disposable
income.
(cid:1) Therefore they will be looking for cheaper insurance, which the stand-alone
product will offer.
• The new target market will be less likely to want to use a broker/agent to sell
them a policy.
(cid:1) They would prefer to purchase online, as they do with many other products
they purchase.
• They would prefer a quick process, with less medical underwriting which is
offered by this product.
(cid:1) The less strict underwriting will however lead to a higher price, which is
counter to what they are looking for.
• The 15-year term is more likely to tie in to the time horizon of younger people.
(cid:1) Whole of life would not feel like a necessary purchase to them.
iii. Existing underwriting process:
• The existing product and process will be fairly traditional and extensive
compared to the new product.
• There will be an underwriting questionnaire.
(cid:1) This will probably be completed with the broker, using pen and paper.
• For larger sums assured, or when risks are identified in the questionnaire.
(cid:1) There may be a medical exam by a doctor or a nurse.
(cid:1) There may be medical tests (blood, ECG, chest x-ray, etc.)

• The insurer thus most likely load premiums, rather than declining cover.
• Financial underwriting may be required to ensure that the level of cover is
appropriate given the annual salary of the applicant to prevent over-insurance.
• It is likely that a human underwriter will assess many of the applications.
Changes likely for the new product:
• The insurer is likely to rely on an underwriting questionnaire which would be a
lot shorter.
• It is likely that the insurer will limit the sum insured for this product.
• The process could have “accept” / “decline” rather than adding loadings.
• Given that the questionnaire is online, it could be dynamic and only ask certain
(additional) questions if disclosures made necessitate this.
• It is likely that more of the underwriting process will go through an underwriting
engine, rather than a human underwriter.
• Claims underwriting may be required to ensure than any material non-disclosures
at inception are dealt with appropriately.
iv. Areas that the regulator would investigate and monitor to ensure that customers are treated
fairly in relation to this product:
• Terms and conditions of the product in terms of whether they are clear and fair.
(cid:1) For example the reasonability of the length of the waiting period, if any.
• Premiums of the product, relation to value for money of the product.
(cid:1) This product only covers four core conditions and at a lower sum insured
than the other product and therefore should have a lower premium.
• Sales and underwriting procedures, particularly the processes in relation to the
online sales.
• Information given to customers at the point of sale, in terms of whether it is clear
and easy to understand.
• This is a complex product and it is important to ensure that customers understand
the complex aspects of the product, for example:
(cid:1) Claims conditions as the lay-person’s interpretation of a heart attack may be
different to the medical definitions used for the claims’ conditions.
(cid:1) Disclosures relating to exclusions, particularly for pre-existing conditions.
(cid:1) Conditions and disclosures relating to reviewable premiums.
• Rating factors used to differentiate premiums are justified by experience and
sufficient data and that there is not unfair discrimination in the rating factors.
• The claims process is not unfair or unduly onerous while protecting the insurer
against fraud, for example:
(cid:1) The process for verifying the declaration of health information at the claim
stage.
(cid:1) The time taken to pay claims.
(cid:1) The number and reasons for repudiating claims
• Potential risk from outsourcing arrangements for online sales or claims processes.
This question required candidates to apply their knowledge to a particular product. Better
candidates were able to structure their answers to be relevant to the specific product.
Part (i) was bookwork and well answered.

In part (ii) a number of candidates gave points on general needs of the target market and
missed points on the needs met by the critical illness product. Many candidates failed to
structure their solutions effectively resulting in wasted time by repeating points.
In part (iii) stronger candidates where able to demonstrate their understanding of the
underwriting process through clearly explained points.
The common mistakes for weaker candidates in part (iv) were listing potential regulations or
requirements rather than areas to investigate or monitor; giving general points around
treating customers fairly rather than tailoring the answer to the product in the question and
giving points on monitoring solvency.

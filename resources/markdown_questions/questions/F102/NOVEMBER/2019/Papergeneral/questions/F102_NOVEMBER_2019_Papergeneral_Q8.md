## QUESTION 8

i. Risks to the policyholder:
• Benefits not received due to:
(cid:1) Policyholder living much longer than expected and hence, because the
monthly income is not guaranteed for life, money could run out.
(cid:1) There is no maximum withdrawal rate so funds can be depleted earlier than
expected.
(cid:1) Insolvency of the insurer.
• Benefits lower than expected due to:
(cid:1) Poor performance of the assets underlying the units resulting in lower benefit
payments.
(cid:1) Policyholders may select investment funds that poorly reflect their risk
appetite and/or need for capital protection, resulting in volatile investment
returns.
(cid:1) The unit fund being eroded by fund management charges, particularly if fund
management charges are revised upwards by the insurer.
(cid:1) Taxation changes impacting on amounts received.
(cid:1) Income received in real terms can be eroded due to high inflation given that
the return of the assets may not necessarily be inflation-linked.
ii. Marketability and competitiveness:
• The flexibility provided by the following features of the product is likely to
increase the marketability of the product:
(cid:1) Withdrawal percentage for monthly income.
(cid:1) Switching of portfolios.
(cid:1) Transfer of funds to another insurer.
• The following features of the product are likely to negatively impact on the
marketability of the product:
(cid:1) Variable charges (increases the risk that charges may deplete the fund value).
(cid:1) No underlying investment guarantees (increases the investment risk for the
policyholder).
(cid:1) The product terms and conditions and product risks are relatively complicated
and may not be easy for a customer to understand.
• The competitiveness of the product is mainly influenced by the level of charges.
• Differentiating product features are also important.

• The insurer may need to consider accepting a lower profit margin or introducing
attractive innovative features to this product in this competitive environment.
Profitability and financing requirements:
• Charges need to cover expenses (including a contribution to fixed costs) in most
foreseeable circumstances and provide a profit margin.
• Profit margins for these policies are likely to be low due to the highly competitive
nature of the market.
• There is a mismatch between the charges and the expenses, particularly due to
high initial costs and the monthly fund management fee.
• The profitability of this business is therefore sensitive to investment experience,
variation in actual expenses amounts and expense inflation and transfers to other
insurers.
• This risk is mitigated by variable charges, although it may be difficult to
implement increases in the charging structure in practice due to marketability and
competitiveness considerations.
• Financing requirements for these policies will depend on the extent of
mismatching between charges and expenses.
• The insurer may use the following techniques to reduce the financing
requirements for this business:
(cid:1) Actuarial funding.
(cid:1) Negative non-unit reserves (if permitted by the regulator).
iii. Impact on assumptions for calculating the non-unit reserves for supervisory reporting:
Investment return on the unit fund:
• The estimate of the expected returns on the unit fund over the projected term of
the policies would need to be adjusted to reflect the change in expected future
economic conditions, taking the following into account:
(cid:1) Asset mix for the investment portfolios and spread of policies across
investment portfolios.
(cid:1) Change in the volatility of future investment returns.
• The inflow amount for charges will depend on the investment return and
withdrawal rate from the unit fund.
Rates of withdrawal on the fund:
• The expected rates of withdrawal on the fund may be reduced if policyholders are
more conservative in poorer economic conditions.
• The expected withdrawal rates may increase if there is an increase in inflation and
a higher income is required to meet expenses.
Expenses and expense inflation:
• Expense inflation may be higher in poorer economic conditions.
• Expense inflation assumption should be consistent with investment returns and
discount rate.

• Allowance for overheads may need to be increased if business volumes for all
products sold by the insurer are reduced in poorer economic conditions.
Persistency/transfer rates:
• Actions of competitors to maintain business volumes in a poor economic
environment (for example reducing charges) may impact on the transfer rates.
Discount rate:
• The risk-free rate will change to reflect the economic environment.
Margins:
• A higher margin for prudence reflecting the uncertainty relating to the
assumptions may be appropriate.
Part (i) was a straight-forward bookmark question, where there were many points which
could have been made and in general well-prepared candidates did well on this question.
Part (iia) was generally well answered with the majority of candidates able to describe the
marketability of the product due its distinct product features. However, part (iib) was poorly
answered, with the majority of candidates making very high-level comments around the
profitability and financing requirements of unit-linked products in general rather than
referring to the specifics of this product.
Part (iii) was very poorly answered. The majority of candidates mainly focused on particular
assumptions (e.g. investment return) and provided too much detail on particular assumptions
rather than ensuring that they covered the full basis of assumptions at a higher level which in
general caused them to score more poorly on this part.

## QUESTION 5

You have recently been appointed to the actuarial department of a large life insurance company with a range of products targeted at high-income customers. The two largest product portfolios are a high sum assured conventional without-profits whole of life product and a 10-year single premium unit-linked endowment product.
The insurance regulator has recently introduced a requirement for the liabilities for supervisory purposes of all insurers in the market to be determined on a market-consistent basis.
i. Describe how the liabilities for the portfolio of the whole life assurance policies would be
determined on a market-consistent basis.
[7]

The managing director of the insurer has heard that option pricing techniques may be used to determine the liabilities for unit-linked products with investment guarantees. She has asked you to explain how market-traded option prices can be used to determine the liabilities for the 10-year single premium unitlinked endowment product.
You are given the following additional information about the product:

- Death and maturity benefits will be equal to the policyholder's fund value, or a return of premiums plus 2% p.a. if higher.

- The underlying fund tracks the performance of the local All-Share Index (with dividends reinvested).

- Surrender benefits will not be guaranteed.

ii. Explain how market-traded option prices can be used to determine the liabilities for this product
and consider whether the approach would be suitable in practice.

## QUESTION 6

You are the product development actuary at a medium-sized life insurance company. Your company has a successful income protection product which it has been selling for many years. The target market for this product is professionals (medical professionals, lawyers, accountants, etc.).
One of your top brokers has come to you with an idea to expand this product. His family owns many food retailers and employs thousands of individuals who perform mainly low-skilled manual tasks. The employees' salaries are between one and two times the country's minimum wage level. The employees work on a monthly contract basis, but many of the employees have worked for the same company, in the same position, for many years.
The broker would like you to design an income protection product for these employees. He says that there are many other companies who have employees with a similar need, and that this product would be the first of its kind in your country.
i. Outline briefly the considerations which you would need to take into account when setting the
benefit definitions for such a new product.

ii. Outline briefly the risks which would be faced by the insurer associated with pricing such a
product.

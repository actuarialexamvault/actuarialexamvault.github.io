## QUESTION 1

i. In general, the assumptions used to determine the liabilities should have regard to the legislation
and accounting principles for published reporting.
Mortality
 Assumptions will be required for the base mortality level and for the level of expected
future mortality improvements.
 The assumptions chosen should be based on the expected demographic profile of
policyholders and have a regard to the country where the annuitants live.
 The prudential margin would be a reduction in base mortality, and faster future mortality
improvements.
Benefit inflation
 It may also be required to allow for the future inflation of benefits, if the annuity is index-
linked.
Expenses
 An allowance for expenses should be included which should reflect expenses expected to
be incurred in administering the annuities.
 An allowance for a share of future expected overhead expenses.
 The prudential margin would be an increase in expenses.
Expense inflation
 An explicit assumption will be required to allow for the future inflation of expenses.
 The inflation assumptions could be based upon the:
 current rates of inflation, for both prices and earnings which can be based on
recent actual experience of the life insurance company or industry; and
 expected future rates of price and earnings inflation which can be based on the
differential between the return on government fixed interest securities and on
government index-linked securities, where they exist.
 The prudential margin would be an increase in expense inflation.
Valuation rate of interest
 A valuation rate of interest will be required which should have regard to the yield on
government bond or corporate bonds (taking default risk into account).
 The level of reinvestment risk should be considered.
 A prudential margin could be included which would reduce the valuation rate of interest.
Taxation
 An allowance for taxation will need to be included as an assumption either explicitly or
implicitly within the assumptions for valuation rate of interest or other assumptions.
ii. The insurer will analyse the surplus arising over a year on the supervisory basis to:
 show the financial effect of divergences between the valuation assumptions and the actual
experience, exposing which assumptions are the more financially significant;
 show the financial effect of writing new business;
 provide a check on the valuation data and process, if carried out independently;
 identify non-recurring components of surplus;
 give management information on trends in the experience of the company; and
 comply with regulatory requirements.

(iii)
iii. Possible responses to these results:
Incorrect calculation or data:
 Use data reconciliations or spot checks on values that appear to be anomalies.
 If errors in the data or calculations are identified the insurer should consider improving
systems and data recording.
 Compare the results from the analysis of surplus with a recent expense experience
investigation to check if the results of the two investigations are consistent.
 Carry out a full expense experience investigation.
 For initial and renewal expenses consider salary, property and computer costs and
identify any once-off expenses.
 Investigate the cause of any adverse experience.
 For example, a high inflationary environment or larger volume of polices with lower
annuity payments where cross-subsidies are assumed.
Changes to assumptions:
 Consider whether this experience should result in a change to valuation and/or pricing
assumptions.
 This will be strongly influenced by whether the cause of the higher than expected
expenses (for example rental costs or salary inflation) is expected to continue in the
future.
 Consider industry or competitors data before making any changes to pricing.
Expense control measures
 Consider implementing expense control measures.
 For example, active control of staffing levels relative to business volumes or ensure that
cost-of-living and grade salary rises are not excessive.
For part (i) candidates who listed a variety of assumptions with a brief description of each assumption
tending to perform better than students who wrote long verbose answers. Many students failed to fully
consider the characteristics of annuity products, including the absence of surrenders or lapses and the
importance of mortality improvements. A significant portion of candidates did not specify the direction
of the margin for it to be prudent.
Part (ii) was bookmark and candidates tended to perform well in this question. It was evident that some
candidates did not know the bookwork for this section.
Overall part (iii) was fairly poorly answered as many candidates focused too much on a single element
for example decreasing expenses. Candidates who performed better tended to write an array of
considerations across various facets of an insurance company.

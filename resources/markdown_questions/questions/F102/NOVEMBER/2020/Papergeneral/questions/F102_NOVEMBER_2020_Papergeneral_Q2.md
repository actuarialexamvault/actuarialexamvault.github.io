## QUESTION 2

i. A couple expecting to retire in 10 years’ time.
Income protection
 This product pays a monthly benefit on incapacity within a specified period. For example,
until retirement age of the policyholder.
 This is needed to protect the couple against financial loss due to loss of the main household
income.
 The income protection may not be needed if sufficient income protection benefits are
provided as part of a group life assurance (GLA) by the employer of one of the couple.
Critical illness
 This product pays a lump sum in the event that the person insured is diagnosed with a severe
illness covered under the policy (for example cancer).
 The couple can use this benefit to pay lifestyle changes after a critical illness event.
 Income protection and critical illness contracts are typically conventional without profits.
Endowments
 This could be in the form of a savings contract (e.g. a pure endowment) where the proceeds
can be used to purchase an annuity on retirement to supplement provision from the employer.
Deferred annuity
 The couple can take out either a deferred annuity instead of an endowment assurance to
provide income during retirement.
 A surrender benefit may be payable during the deferred period.
 The key benefit is payment of a regular income, provided the customer survives to a specified
date.
 It would not be needed if either are employed and the employer provides an adequate
corporate pension scheme.
 Endowment and deferred annuity products are typically written as with profits or unit-linked.
ii. Tourism company
Group life assurance (GLA)
 This product provides benefits on the death of a member of staff while they are employed,
normally to their dependants.
 Normally the benefit is set in terms of a multiple of the employee’s salary, e.g. 3 x annual
salary.
 Offering such benefits as part of the employment contract meets the customer’s need of
retaining and attracting good staff.
 Staff members might need additional benefits to cover repatriation of their body to their home
town on death.
 This product is typically written as conventional without-profit on an annually renewable
basis.

Key person insurance
 Would be written on the lives of key personnel, providing payment of a lump sum on their
death, including the two owners of the company.
 It gives the company protection against financial loss from the death of key members of staff.
 This product is typically written as conventional without-profit.
Group pension scheme
 This can be offered as either deferred annuity or endowment assurance form.
 Provides retirement benefits for the staff. The cost could be shared with the employees by
making the scheme contributory.
 As above, this meets the customer’s need of retaining and attracting good staff.
 Typically written as with-profit or unit-linked.
Immediate annuities
 The company might purchase immediate annuities to provide retirement benefits emerging
from the pension scheme.
 This removes longevity risk from the company.
 Typically written as conventional without-profit.
This question was not well answered. Many candidates failed to give a wide enough range of suitable
products and failed to cover how products would meet the needs of the couple or the tourism company.
For part (ii) many candidates considered the needs of the partners and the employees rather than the
objectives of the tourism company and focused on individual products rather than group cover. A
number of candidates failed to fully answer the question and give the likely structure of the products in
their solutions.

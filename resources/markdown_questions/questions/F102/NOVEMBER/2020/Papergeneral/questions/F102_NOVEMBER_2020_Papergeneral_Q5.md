## QUESTION 5

i. The value of the liabilities for the whole life policies on market-consistent basis would be
determined as follows:
 A market-consistent value of a liability should be determined as the price that someone would
charge for taking responsibility for the liability, in a market in which such liabilities are freely
traded. Where this information is not available approximate measures are used.
Cashflow projection approach.
 Project the expected liability cashflows in each future year, under the portfolio of whole life
assurance policies.
 These cashflows would include guaranteed benefit payments, regular commission payments,
ongoing expenses and premiums.
 Market consistent assumptions might be found as follows:
 Mortality assumptions could be determined from reinsurance risk premium rates;
 Expense assumptions could be determined from expense agreements available in the
market e.g. third party administration companies; and
 Inflation assumption could be determined from the difference between risk-free fixed
interest and inflation-linked bonds of similar term.
 As it may not be practical to find market-consistent expense and demographic assumptions, the
cashflow projections would therefore be made on a best estimate basis plus margins to allow
for the uncertainty of the payments.
 This may be done by applying the margin to each such assumption or by using the “cost
of capital” approach.
 The projected cash flows would then be discounted at current risk-free rates of interest.
 The risk-free rate of interest to discount a cashflow due in t years’ time would be the current
market redemption yield on a secure zero-coupon government bond of the same term.
 Swap rates may be used if the swap market is sufficiently deep.
 Alternatively, high quality corporate bond could be used, with an adjustment to the yield, to
allow for any credit risk.
 Inflation-linked bond returns could be used for inflation-linked liabilities such as expenses.
Replicating portfolio
 A replicating portfolio of assets could be selected as a portfolio of zero-coupon bonds with
exactly the same future cashflows as the projected liability flows under the model.
 The uncertainty in the timing of the cashflows remains and therefore the required term of the
zero-coupon bonds.
 The current market value of this portfolio could then be considered as the market-consistent
valuation of the book of whole life assurance policies.
 The market values of the replicating portfolio of assets may need adjustment for any short-term
anomalies in the market at the present time.

ii. The investment guarantee in the 10-year single premium unit-linked product is analogous to
options traded in the market place:
 Guaranteed minimum maturity values correspond to European put options.
 Guaranteed minimum death values could be viewed as corresponding to American put options.
 However European options can also be used if the timing of the expected guaranteed future
death benefits can be estimated.
 The underlying asset for the options is the local All-Share total return index.
 The exercise price corresponds to the death and maturity guarantee.
 For the in-force endowments, the expected minimum guaranteed benefits on a per-policy basis
using the guaranteed minimum return needs to be projected.
 From this the insurer will obtain a schedule of expected guaranteed minimum death and
maturity benefits.
 The insurer will also need to determine the level of the All-Share index corresponding to the
minimum guaranteed benefits, as this will be used to determine the required exercise price on
the options.
 The market price of the options of relevant term and exercise price will be used to determine
the liability for the investment guarantees.
This method is unlikely to be suitable since:
 The method requires market prices for a very large number of put options (there will be many
combinations of terms and exercise prices required).
 Even in developed markets it may be difficult to find all the market prices needed, it will be
even more impractical in a developing country.
 Market prices may be distorted by short-term factors.
 The insurer may wish to be more prudent than that derived from market prices.
Part (i) was a straightforward question and most candidates scored well. Some candidates struggled to
give details of how the market consistent assumptions for the discounted cashflow model are set. A few
candidates neglected to discuss the replicating portfolio as an alternative valuation approach. Where
they did, the details were sparse. Some candidates spent too much time discussing the cost of capital
approach or the adjustments to the assumptions to allow for the illiquidity premiums which did not yield
many marks. Some candidates spoke about the valuation of assets and the valuation of an endowment,
which was not asked for in the question.
The majority of candidates struggled with part (ii). Some candidates failed to provide specific types of
put options to use for maturity and death benefits, e.g. European/American put options respectively.
A number of candidates neglected to answer the second part of the question regarding the efficacy of
using option pricing and hence failed to score valuable marks. A few candidates explained how option
pricing works in general without applying themselves to the specific situation provided in the question.

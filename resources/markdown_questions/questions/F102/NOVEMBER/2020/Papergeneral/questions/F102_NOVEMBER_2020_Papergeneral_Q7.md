## QUESTION 7

i. Impacts on the company and risks faced:
Market risk
 Investments may have lost value due to the economic challenges, resulting in lower free
assets.
 Some investments (e.g. equity and property) may take a long time to recover.
 Short-term volatility of investments may have increased resulting in higher capital
requirements for more volatile investments (e.g. equities).
 The impact of the lower asset values and increased solvency requirements depend on how
well capitalised the insurer is.
 For longer term investments, there is potentially greater reinvestment risk as yields may be
lower in the short term and higher in the long term.
Business volumes
 The poor economic environment and restrictions in business may result in lower business
volumes which would put strain on the insurer’s ability to recover expenses.
 There may be a move towards lower premiums resulting in lower sum assured policies. If
higher sum assured policies were priced to cross-subsidise lower sum assured policies this
would result in an under recovery of expenses.
 Brokers and agents may move to other types of employment resulting in fewer intermediaries
selling policies and lower business volumes.
 Salaried agents are likely to generate less new business resulting in losses to the insurer.
Expenses
 Economic circumstances may result in an increased price inflation impacting on the inflation
of expenses for the insurer.
Withdrawal risk
 There may be an increase in withdrawals due to pressure on the affordability of premiums due
to higher unemployment rates and failure of small businesses.
 This is a risk to the insurer at early policy durations when the asset share is negative.
 Such withdrawals are also likely to be selective, resulting in a worsening of the mortality
experience on the in-force business.
Credit risk
 The poor economic climate may result in a higher chance of default by corporate debt
providers.
 The poor economic outlook may result in a deterioration in credit ratings. This results in
higher future borrowing costs and an increase in the capital requirements for investments with
worsening credit ratings.

Mortality and morbidity risk
 There may be an increase in deaths, particularly in respect of lives most exposed to the health
pandemic.
 Policyholders may also not be able to access healthcare facilities if they have reached
capacity, and/or may be unwilling to do so for fear of contracting the disease – exacerbating
the situation with respect to mortality.
 Future experience would depend on how the company deals with underwriting, pricing and
policy design going forward.
 There may be an increase in expected claims on disability, particularly if there is an increase
in fraudulent claims due to the economic recession.
 There may be a long-term impact on claims experience for income protection policies if there
is an increase in the factors that impact on the health of policyholders due to the a reduction in
usage of health care facilities in the outbreak period, poor economic environment and
business restrictions.
Data risk
 Accuracy of death data will make insights from experience investigations for pricing
challenging in the medium term.
 Clients will also have changed their behaviour and there is risk in the medium term that data
from the past may be less relevant, and that new models and the parameters associated may be
incorrect.
Competition risk
 Pressure on the income of individuals and businesses may result in increased competition.
 Competitors leveraging digital capabilities may have a competitive advantage in the restricted
business environment.
Operational risk
 Business restrictions may impact the business activities of the insurer, particularly in the areas
of sales and servicing of products.
Reputational risk
 The reputation of the insurer and the insurance industry in general may be negatively
impacted by failure to pay claims due to exclusions relating to pandemics.
 This may result in an increase in complaints, an increase in policy withdrawals and reduced
new business volumes.
Strategic risk
 Management and directors may experience challenges in responding to the changes in the
economy and business environment.
 Investors may require higher returns on capital and may require the insurer to take higher
risks in more competitive markets to meet stakeholder expectations.
Reinsurance
 Increase in cost of reinsurance, greater risk of default or risk to reinsurers not honouring
claims due to exclusions on reinsurance policies.

ii. Actions that the company could take:
 Ensure that assets and liabilities are suitably matched to manage better the guaranteed
liabilities or to better manage potential greater reinvestment risks in the future.
 Improve sales through the broker channel by ensuring good relationships and providing
additional support to brokers in the challenging circumstances.
 Expand sales channels to access a wider customer base. For example, through telemarketing,
partnerships or online methods.
 Focus on increasing retention activities and improved customer analytics and associated
engagement with policyholders.
 Engage with distribution channels and consider changes to remuneration associated to
facilitate better client retention, cross-sell and upsell.
 Consider whether to exit some lines of business (e.g. income protection).
 Consider whether to increase premiums based on the additional risk for new business or
reviewable premium business.
 Although it may be difficult to increase new business and reviewable premiums due to
affordability constraints in the current economic environment.
 Consider whether to move to reviewable premium business, which needs to be balanced also
against long term reputation risk.
 Management of expenses is key in being able to ensure that earnings and capital remain
viable in the medium to long term.
 The outbreak may heighten the urgency for the company to consider the viability of investing
in automation, and digital self-servicing to meet client needs and save costs.
 Consolidation in the industry may allow benefits to be unlocked and economies of scale to be
recognised.
 More frequent reporting and focus on key risk metrics and associated with mitigating actions.
 Repricing policies going forward. (It may not be known how long the outbreak will last.)
 Introduce exclusion clauses on new business (but may have a reputational risk).
 Seek appropriate reinsurance cover, this could include financing if required.
 Increase the rigour in underwriting to prevent anti-selection.
A number of candidates made a reasonable attempt in both parts of the question.
Most candidates did not highlight enough points to score very well in part (i) given the high mark
allocation. Some failed to articulate risks they specified mitigation for in (ii).
Some candidates did not make the best use of time by repeating the same point in different ways or by
expanding too much in trying to explain why the point listed was valid.
Good students were able to present in a structured way several valid points such that each was clearly
articulated and able to demonstrate relevance in the context specified in the question.

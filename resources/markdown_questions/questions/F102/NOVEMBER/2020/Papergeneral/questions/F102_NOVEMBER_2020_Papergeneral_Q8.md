## QUESTION 8

i. Suitability of corporate bonds:
 The assets match the benefit liabilities in respect of:
 Nature: The non-profit annuity is fixed in nature, while the corporate bond returns are
fixed in nature (provided they are held to maturity).
 Currency: The assets and liabilities are both in local currency terms.
 It is unclear if the assets match the liabilities by term, however this may be unlikely since:
 Life annuities are likely to have long terms (exceeding 20 years).
 Corporate bonds are unlikely to exceed 20 years due to the investment risk associated
with such a long term.
 It is therefore likely that there exists significant reinvestment risk for the insurer in
needing to roll-over the investments.
 As this is a developing country, there may not be a well-developed corporate bond
market, which will make it difficult to achieve exact term matching.
 The insurer’s expenses in respect of annuities are real in nature, and therefore the bonds do
not provide a suitable match by nature for these liabilities.
 Corporate bonds are likely to be far less liquid than government bonds, however this may
not be a large concern for the insurer if bonds can be held to maturity.
 Corporate bonds carry a risk of default, and this is unlikely to make them suitable for
matching guaranteed benefits:
 The insurer may have a high level of capital assets to absorb some defaults, however it
is unlikely to have sufficient free assets in the event of large-scale defaults.
 Corporate bonds are likely to offer higher expected returns compared to government bonds,
to compensate for the higher default risk and lower liquidity:
 This may allow the insurer to offer better annuity rates than competitors (provided it
only takes credit for the liquidity premium, not the default risk premium).
ii. The insurer can use a model to determine the suitability of proposed investment strategies as
follows:
 The liabilities, minimum regulatory capital and the assets are projected forward on
assumptions that represent expected future experience.
 The insurer will also consider the effect of variations in the assumptions on the asset and
liability projections.
 The insurer will determine an appropriate projection period (e.g. for the current strategic
business planning or capital planning period) and an appropriate projection frequency (e.g.
quarterly but at least annually to provide sufficient information on the free assets of the
insurer).
 Liabilities and regulatory minimum required capital will be projected on the current
supervisory basis based on the:
 Current in-force policies using all the individual policies or model points and
expected future new business using model points for the expect profile of new
policyholders.
 Assumptions for this model should be consistent with the assumptions for the asset
model (e.g. the inflation rate should be consistent with investments returns).

 Assets (including free assets) will be projected using:
 A stochastic investment model to simulate future investment returns and capital gains
and losses.
 The asset mix will be based on the current asset mix and expected future changes in
asset mix.
 Considering any regulatory restrictions on asset admissibility and liquidity needs of
the insurer.
 The level of free assets will be determined at the end of each quarter for the entire projection
period.
 The insurer will assess whether the projected levels of free assets meet the requirement of free
assets being at least double of the minimum capital required by the regulator.
 The stochastic models can be run many (1000s) of times using the randomly generated
investment returns.
 This will produce a statistical distribution of the free assets relative to the regulatory
minimum required capital available each quarter.
 From this, the probability of not meeting the insurer’s targeted level of free assets can be
estimated given a particular investment strategy.
 The insurer will repeat the process for the different proposed investment strategies.
 The investment strategy that meets the targeted level of free assets in each quarter with the
highest probability may be selected.
 The insurer may also assess the effect of the investment strategy on future shareholder
earnings and choose an investment strategy that maximises future shareholder income
achieving the targeted level of free assets with a certain probability.
For part (i) candidates who scored well gave a wide range of points focusing on the current investment
strategy relative to the liabilities and the expenses. A number of candidates lost time giving points on
improved investment strategies which was not asked for in the question.
For part (ii) weaker candidates gave vague and general points on modelling instead of focusing on the
modelling of the assets and the liabilities for this product. Stronger candidates considered the steps for
modelling assets and liabilities with a stochastic model for investment returns.

## QUESTION 3

You work for a start-up insurance company which plans to start selling business in a few months' time. Your first product will be a regular premium 10-year unit-linked endowment assurance with a maximum guaranteed sum insured of R1 million. Policyholders will be allowed to vary the guaranteed sum insured during the policy term, provided it does not exceed the sum assured selected at the start of the policy. The only charge on the product will be an annual management charge, which will be the same fixed percentage for all policyholders.
Your marketing manager proposes that, because the maximum sum insured is quite low, there should be no initial underwriting on the product besides asking the applicant to state that they are in good health.
i. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the marketing manager's proposal.
[5]

The insurer is negotiating an Obligatory/Obligatory reinsurance arrangement.
ii. Outline briefly the advantages and disadvantages to the insurer of entering into this type of reinsurance
arrangement.
[3]

Some initial underwriting will be implemented as a condition to the reinsurance arrangement. It has been agreed with the reinsurer that underwriting will be limited to encourage sales.
iii. Describe an initial underwriting programme that would be suitable for this product.
[4]

iv. State 4 ways in which the product design could be changed to reduce the risk of poor mortality experience,
other than using initial underwriting.

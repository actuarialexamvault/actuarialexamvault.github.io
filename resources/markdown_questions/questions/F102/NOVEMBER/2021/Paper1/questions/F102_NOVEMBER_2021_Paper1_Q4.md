## QUESTION 4

Income protection (IP) insurance in a particular developed country is highly competitive, which has led to substantial losses for all life insurers over the last five years. The local regulator has decided to intervene to ensure that new IP policies issued are sold on a sustainable basis.
The regulator's proposals include: A. A limit on the maximum benefit amount of 100% of policyholders' net of tax income during the first six months of benefit payment and 75% thereafter; these limits are lower than benefit amounts currently offered by most insurers.
B. A maximum benefit payment term of ten years; current products pay an income up to retirement age.
C. A limit of five years on the period of guaranteed premium rates, after which premiums may be reviewed
by the insurance company; current products are sold on a fully guaranteed basis.
i. Outline the likely impact on policyholders of each of the proposals.

ii. Outline the main risks and challenges to insurance companies posed by the proposals.

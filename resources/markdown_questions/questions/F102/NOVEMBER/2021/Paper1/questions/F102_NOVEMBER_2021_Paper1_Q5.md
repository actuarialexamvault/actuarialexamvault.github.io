## QUESTION 5

An insurer writes stand-alone whole life conventional critical illness contracts covering four core conditions. The insurer has received requests from many policyholders to increase the sum assured on their contracts substantially.
i. Explain how the equating policy values method can be used to calculate the revised premium rate for an
increased sum assured on these contracts.
[4]

The insurer has decided to review the product design. One of the changes being considered for new contracts is the inclusion of an option that allows the policyholder to increase the sum assured by 10% for each subsequent year after the exercise date of the option. The option can be exercised at any time during the contract without the need to provide any evidence of health at that time.
ii. Outline briefly, the issues that should be considered before making the suggested change to the product design.
[5]

iii. Suggest ways for the insurer to minimise its anti-selection risk on the option to increase the sum assured
described above.

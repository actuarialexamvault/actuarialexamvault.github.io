## QUESTION 1

i.
Expropriation price:
 The expropriation price is the price at which a company would cancel a unit, and
is calculated as:
 The market bid price value of assets held by the fund;
 less the expenses incurred in the purchase and stamp (and other duties)
payable in respect of such a purchase;
 plus the value of any current assets, such as cash on deposit or investments
sold but not yet settled;
 less the value of any current liabilities, such as investments purchased but
not yet settled or loans to the fund;
 plus any accrued income such as interest income from fixed-interest
securities and deposits, net of any outgo, such as fund charges;
 less any allowance for accrued tax, if applicable.
 This gives the net asset value of the fund on a bid basis, which is divided by the
number of existing units at the valuation date.
ii.
Principal risks:
 Unit prices are generally set at discrete points in time, whereas the underlying asset
values effectively change continuously.
 This is a particular risk if:
 The underlying asset values are volatile or if there is a sudden once-off
movement in market values.
 Any timing delay in adjusting unit price introduces a pricing risk for the
company due to the mismatch between the company’s liabilities, dependent
on the unit price, and the value of the underlying assets.
 The unit price calculation would include some approximations, including:
 An allowance for tax on unrealised capital gains.
 An allowance for accrued assets and liabilities, e.g. accrued interest not yet
received.
 Estimates of the market value of assets, where the market value is not
immediately observable.
 For example, property, as there is a risk that the actual values are very
different to the estimates.
 There could be errors in the actual unit price calculations:
 This could be a particular risk if:
 Unit prices are based on the appropriation/ expropriation prices of the
underlying assets, depending on whether the company is creating
additional (net) units or cancelling (net) units. There is a risk that the
company uses the wrong basis when calculating the unit prices.
 The unit prices could be based on incorrect data (e.g. the asset managers
provided the incorrect market values of assets).
 There could be an error in the calculation process/ method.

 Although regulations generally do not specify how units are to be priced,
regulations may restrict what policy charges, for example, may be included in the
unit price. Any changes to regulation could be a risk to the company (e.g. if
regulation is incorrectly interpreted the prices determined may be incorrect and
need subsequent correction).
Part (i) was bookwork and it is expected that candidates score well. However, a number of
candidates struggled to get good marks.
For part (ii) candidates needed to focus on the justification of how errors could have
occurred, rather than listing all the aspects of the calculation and indicating that there may
be an error. The majority of candidates failed to score well on this question. Some candidates
gave general risks instead of considering the risks when deriving the price of a unit.

SOLUTION 2
i.
Accumulating with-profits:
 Bonuses are declared annually in relation to the premiums paid to date and previously
declared bonuses, with an interim bonus applying for claims between bonus
declarations.
 There may be a guaranteed minimum annual bonus. This minimum could be zero.
 A terminal bonus may be added at maturity and possibly withdrawal.
 The insurer may be able to apply a market value reduction (MVR) on withdrawal.
 Regulation or market practice may dictate that the MVR is zero.
 Bonuses declared and the MVA are at the discretion of the insurer, subject to
policyholder expectations.
ii.
General
 The general principle will be to use historical experience to derive best estimates of
each assumption, and adjust for expected future conditions for the period the
assumptions will apply.
Accumulating with-profits business
 With-profits fund growth:
 Expected return on the with-profits fund based on the asset mix of the fund.
 This return will be reduced for expected investment expenses (these will
be based on the product information for investments available in the
market).
 These returns may be compared to government bonds of suitable term.
 A stochastic investment model is required if there is a minimum guarantee
on regular bonuses or the MVR is zero.
 Expenses:
 Use the recent expense investigation i.e. the expenses allocated to this
product.
 Allowance needs to be made for expected business volumes and new
business mix in terms of size of premiums to allocate overheads.
 Expense inflation:
 Needs to be a mix of salary and price inflation.
 Assumptions for expense inflation need to be consistent with the
assumptions for the growth in the with-profit fund and risk discount rate
assumptions.
 Withdrawal assumptions:
 Needs to be based on the past experience for this business adjusted for
expected future changes.
 The insurer may consider expected future economic conditions and
employment rates and how this may impact on the withdrawal experience
for this business.
 Tax:
 Is based on current tax rates on this type of business and expected changes.
 Profit margin:
 Will be based on the required profit from the business.

 Risk discount rate:
 Will be based on risk free rate (yield on government bonds) with an
allowance for return for shareholders and to reflect the risk of the business.
 Margins for uncertainty may be included in the individual assumptions or
allowed for in the risk discount rate.
Group life business
 Mortality rates:
 Use the recent mortality investigation for this product.
 Depending on the amount of internal data insurer has, mortality rates may
be combined with standard table rates using credibility theory.
 Mortality rates may be calculated separately for different industries.
 Permanent disability rates:
 Follow a similar process to that of mortality assumptions.
 Although data will be more limited for permanent disability cover.
 Expenses:
 Expenses will be determined in a similar way to the accumulating with-
profits product.
 Expense inflation is not relevant as the product is renewed every year.
 Profit margin:
 Margins for uncertainty are likely to be included in the assumptions.
 These margins maybe significant if there is less data on which to base
assumptions.
Part (i) was largely a bookmark. However, many candidates did not focus sufficiently on the
specifics of how bonuses are awarded and hence did not cover how market value reductions
could also be applied.
Part (ii) was fairly poorly answered overall. Too many students spoke about how to conduct
detailed experience investigations (despite the question indicating that this was not required).
In general, there insufficient emphasis was placed on the specific considerations relating to
each product in the question. There a lack of breadth in the assumptions considered e.g. very
few candidates spoke about with-profits fund growth, taxation, risk discount rate and profit
margin.

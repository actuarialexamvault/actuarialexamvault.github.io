## QUESTION 3

i.
Advantages
 No initial underwriting will make the product more attractive and will lead to more
sales than if there were initial underwriting.
 This could allow the company to reach viability quickly, assuming the product is
priced correctly.
 No initial underwriting will reduce the company’s up-front costs as it would not
need to hire medical underwriters.
 The risk is also reduced as this is a unit-linked product, and so may be meeting a
savings need and not just protection.
Disadvantages
 As there are no medical checks the company opens itself up to anti-selection.
 The impact will depend on what the market practice is relating to initial
underwriting, the risk of anti-selection is higher if other insurers use initial
underwriting.
 Furthermore, people who are sick could fail to disclosure their state of health and
take up the policy.
 Higher than expected claims will lead to losses to the insurer, even though the sum
assured is low.
 Although the company could decline some claims based on the health question,
claim rejections may be challenged on grounds of different interpretations of “good
health”.
 Declining too many claims will also not be good for the company’s reputation.
ii.
Obligatory/ Obligatory Reinsurance
Advantages:
 The insurer has guaranteed cover for each risk placed.
 The insurer knows up front what maximum risk that it can accept.
 The insurer is likely to get more comprehensive service, and better long term
pricing, if they give more business to one reinsurer.
Disadvantages:
 The insurer has to cede a certain amount of the risk to the reinsurer.
 This may mean giving away more profit than they would like to.
 It is more likely that the treaty reinsurer will have some say in the underwriting and
claims management process.
iii.
Underwriting:
 For very small sums insured, below R100,000 say, a declaration of health may still
be sufficient.

 For larger sums insured, start by introducing some medical questions into the
application form.
 These could include any pre-existing conditions, current health conditions,
family history.
 If they answer “yes” to any of the questions then they could be asked to do any of
the following:
 Fill in a more detailed questionnaire.
 Undergo a medical examination with a nurse or doctor.
 Have blood tests carried out.
 For the maximum sum insured you could ask for a declaration of income, or proof
of debt (if that is the purpose of the cover).
iv.
Possible changes to the product design:
 Reduce the maximum guaranteed sum insured.
 Introduce a waiting period before people become eligible to claim the guaranteed
sum insured.
 Link the product to a specific financial need, e.g. repayment of a housing loan on
death.
 Remove the flexibility to increase the guaranteed sum insured once it has been
reduced, to avoid anti-selection.
 Introduce a mortality charge, to explicitly charge for the sum at risk.
 This charge can be varied by policyholder mortality risk factors.
 Ensure that all charges on the policy are reviewable at the discretion of the insurer.
For part (i) candidates were generally able to identify the advantages of limited underwriting.
Weaker candidates failed to discuss the risk of anti-selection and relying on claim
underwriting in sufficient detail.
Part (ii) was a relatively straight forward question. A number of candidates scored poorly in
this question because they discussed general the merits of reinsurance rather than focusing
on the advantages and disadvantages of the specific type of reinsurance treaty in the question.
For part (iii) stronger candidates differentiated the underwriting approach relative the level
of sum assured and discussed options for additional underwriting for higher risk applicants.
Weaker candidates gave too much detail on information to be collected from a questionnaire.
For part (iv) weaker candidates gave general methods of managing anti-selection risk and
failed to focus on project design changes.

SOLUTION 4
i.
Limit on amounts (Proposal A):
 The proposed regulations place limits on the benefits that insurance companies may
offer, which may mean that the reduced benefits may not fully meet financial needs
of policyholders.
 Reduced benefits would mean lower premiums which would make these policies
more affordable.
Limit on benefit payment term (Proposal B):
 This limitation is likely to severely impact policyholder needs and resulting
unappealing and unmarketable benefits from the perspective of most
policyholders.
 It will have much less impact on policyholders closer to retirement age, and a
larger impact on younger policyholders.
Limit on guaranteed term (Proposal C):
 This creates some uncertainty for policyholders who may not be able to afford
large unexpected increases in premium rates.
 Steep increases could lead to policyholders lapsing and being left without cover.
ii.
Risks and challenges:
 Products will need to be repriced and there might not be data available on claims and
policyholder behaviour under new policy conditions.
 New product features may be unattractive to customers, leading to reduced sales and
premium volumes, which may result in companies not recouping expenses.
 It is difficult to predict the impact of these changes under different economic
conditions. This adds the uncertainty of the impact of these changes.
 If policyholders do not understand that benefits are governed by legislation, they will
blame the companies for poor benefits leading to reputational risks for companies.
 The indirect impact of these regulatory changes may be lower future product innovation
and greater standardisation.
 Product standardisation could lead to products being mostly differentiated by price and
high competition could lead to unsustainably-low premium rates.
 Changing administrative and other processes may be difficult and costly.
iii.
Advantages:
 There may be an improvement in the underwriting experience on these products due to
the benefit reducing after six months, as this is likely to encourage some claimants to
return to work leading to shorter average claim durations, depending on the length of
the deferred period for these products.
 As the levels of guarantees offered are reduced, the capital requirements on these
products should also reduce, helping improve the financial position of insurance
companies in difficulty.

 Limiting benefits to ten years materially reduces the assumption risk for an insurer, as
a short projection period improves the reliability of modelling for pricing and reserving
purposes.
 It may also be easier to find investments of suitable matching terms.
 Limiting rate guarantees to five years also helps as any mispricing or worse than
expected experience could be corrected for (at least partially) after a 5-year initial rate
guarantee period.
 Although there are likely to be challenges in implementing premium increases
in practice.
 Due to the competitive nature of the market, it might have been difficult to have
implemented measures to make the product more financially viable without regulatory
intervention.
This question was fairly straightforward and the majority of students scored well as expected.

SOLUTION 5
i.
Equating policy values method for calculating the revised premium rate for increased sum
assured on these contracts.
 The value of the existing contract will be calculated using prospective or retrospective
method.
 The basis used to calculate the policy value for the existing contract should be between
a realistic basis based on actual experience (used to calculate the asset share) and basis
used to price the original contract.
 This will be equated to the policy value for the altered contract using a prospective
method.
 Plus alteration expenses and additional commission for the increase in the sum
assured (if applicable).
 The mortality assumptions will be based on the expected mortality of the policyholder,
based on the underwriting applied at the date of the increase in the sum assured.
 The renewal assumptions will be based expenses and expense inflation at the date of
the alteration.
 The terms and premium basis for the increased sum assured should be consistent with
the premium basis and terms for new policies.
 The premium for the altered policy should not be higher than the premium for a new
contract for the same sum assured, to avoid the risk of lapse and re-entry.
 The choice of the basis used will impact the profit that is being recognised by the insurer
and consideration would be given towards fairness of profit recognised between the
shareholder and policyholder.
ii.
Product design change considerations:
 Ease of explaining the new option – for some target markets it may be too complex.
 Whether this change adequately meets customer needs, e.g. a CPI-linked annual
increase might meet the customer needs better.
 Affordability of the added option to potential customers.
 Whether the option should be a voluntary add-on at sale or a required feature.
 There is likely to be an anti-selection risk as customers in poorer health are more likely
to exercise the option than those in better health – the insurer should consider ways to
manage and minimise this risk.
 The difficulties associated with pricing and valuing this option need to be considered.
 In particular, data needed to estimate the option cost might be limited as this is
a new feature.
 Consider the potential risk of lapse and re-entry and how this can be managed.
 Any other administrative issues specifically related to administering and engaging with
customers to effect the option and to record their decision.
 The impact on the capital needs (and financing requirements) since this option will
likely result in an increase in capital requirements given the increased risk the insurer
is exposed to.

 Any potential reaction from competitors and how this affects the profitability of the
insurer.
 Consideration should be given to the consistency of the option with other options
offered by the insurer as this could simplify the administration effort and also impact
lapse and re-entry risk.
 Any impact on existing reinsurance arrangements and whether or not the additional
cover will also be reinsured.
 In particular, will be insurer be comfortable to underwrite the additional risk
without underwriting?
iii.
Minimising anti-selection risk:
 Limit the sum assured increases if CPI is likely to fall below 10%. For example, the
insurer might consider a min of CPI and the 10% to help keep the option affordable
and avoid over-insurance.
 Some form of financial underwriting might be considered.
 The timing of exercising the option may be limited, for example:
 The option might only be exercisable on certain life events (annual salary
increase, marriage, divorce or birth of a child).
 May impose a limited number of exercise dates.
 May impose a maximum age for the exercise of the option.
 May impose a maximum duration for the exercise of the option (cover
increases after 10 years may require underwriting).
 Consider imposing a maximum initial sum assured for the option or maximum sum
assured after increases.
 May impose maximum policy term.
 May need to restrict the option to lives accepted at standard terms.
 The insurer can ensure that the option is priced prudently with margins while ensuring
the pricing does not become so high that only the high risks take out the policy.
In part (i) a number of candidates lost marks for giving vague points or only giving the equation
of value. Many candidates failed to discuss the basis considerations in the approach. Weaker
candidates made “absolute” statements such as “the insurer must use the prospective approach
…" which might not hold in all cases and therefore did not earn credit.
For part (ii) candidates who focussed on the main product design considerations scored well.
Weaker candidates gave too many points on pricing considerations and failed to cover other
critical aspects in the design of the option.
For part (iii) candidates who gave specific suggestions which were well explained scored
well.

SOLUTION 6
i.
Description of the model required to calculate the present value of future profits to
shareholders:
 The model would use an appropriate risk discount rate to reflect the level of risk
associated with the portfolio of policies.
 The risk discount rate may be lower than the risk discount rate used in pricing policies
because there is less uncertainty relating to existing business.
 The model should project the expected future cashflows, for example, expected
premiums, claims and expense cash flows under the funeral policy book.
 Future supervisory reserves should also be projected.
 Proper allowance must be made for guaranteed alteration terms such as benefit
increases.
 Assumptions will be made for mortality, lapses, renewal expenses and expense
inflation.
 The model parameters should reflect the realistic experience expected of the target
market.
 The model should allow for the variation in mortality levels for different lives
covered under the policy, for example, grandparents vs children.
 Allowance should be made for interactions and correlations between different
variables.
 In particular, those that should remain consistent, for example, inflation rates and
interest rates.
 The model will use all the in-force policies.
 Alternatively, the model should allow for different model points representing various
product features and customer profiles.
 The frequency of cash flow projections must be short enough to produce reliable
results, preferably annually.
 The model will produce the net present value of future profits to shareholders on the
basis described above.
 The model should also allow for the variation of parameters in order to determine the
sensitivity of the expected future profits to shareholders to the assumptions.
ii.
The impact on the value of the shareholders share of net assets:
 The value of the assets should increase as there is a lower outflow for new business.
 The value of liabilities for new business should increase as future commission
payments will be reserved for.
 The overall effect may be positive, but it will depend on:
 Any differences in the value of the initial commission and the total aggregate value
of new regular commission payments over the term of the policy.
 Impact of discounting the regular commission payments.

The impact on the present value of future profits to shareholders:
 Profit in future years may increase due to the release of the prudent reserves for regular
commission payments compared to expected commission payments based on realistic
assumptions.
 Although there may be less prudence in the reserving assumption there is less
uncertainty in future commission payments compared to other assumptions.
Potential changes in the overall profitability of the policies:
 If aggregate regular commission payments are lower than the initial commission
payments the profitability of the products should increase.
 If the investment returns on the reserves set aside for future commission payments are
higher than the discount rate then the insurer will make a profit.
 The longer the term of the contract, the higher the impact of the change.
 Persistency may improve under the new commission regulations which will increase
the profitability overall for new policies.
 Intermediaries selling the product may prefer upfront commission.
 Possible lower sales volumes may cause an under recovery of expenses with a
reduction in profitability of new policies.
 The interaction of all these potential changes will determine whether the overall profit
under the new commission structure is higher than for the old structure.
In part (i) the majority of candidates were able to describe the basic framework of the model,
i.e. the data required, the cashflows to be projected, the assumptions required and the need to
discount the cashflows to find the present value of future profits. Very few of candidates made
the points around allowing for guarantees, allowing for variation in mortality levels of the
different lives, allowing for variation in parameters to profit test, or expanding on why the
discount rate for the profit model may be different from the one used in the pricing basis.
Part (ii) was generally very poorly answered. Few candidates correctly differentiated between
the impact on assets and liabilities versus the impact on profit. Most candidates failed to state
that the liabilities would increase, or that the release of these liabilities reserved for on a
prudent basis, may cause profits to increase as these reserves are released over time. Very few
candidates considered that there would be positive and negative impacts and that the full
impact would depend on the relative sizes of each impact.

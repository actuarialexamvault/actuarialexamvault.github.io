## QUESTION 8

i.
 Project the net liability cash outgo expected in each future year – this will be the
expected benefit payments and expenses, less future premiums.
 Best estimate assumptions are required. In particular for mortality, lapses, expenses
and expense inflation.
 A margin for uncertainty may need to be added to the best estimate view of each
assumption so that the reserve is not understated, to reflect the additional return
required by a market participant e.g. a reinsurer to take on the mortality risk, or an
external administrator to do admin. Credit was also given for explaining the use of the
cost of capital approach on the liability as a whole to allow for margin).
 The market consistent value can be found by discounting the cashflows at the current
risk-free rates of interest.
 The risk-free rates for cashflows in the future would be determined by using yields on
a government zero-coupon bond of the same term (or alternatively a swap curve if
swaps are sufficiently deep and liquid).
 A small deduction for credit risk may be made.
 Depending on prevailing regulations, an increase to the risk-free rate used to discount
may be acceptable if the insurer is invested in corporate bonds of appropriate term to
account for the illiquidity premium.
ii.
Mortality investigation:
 Consider the period of data to be used for the product so that information is not outdated
– but so that the amount of data is sufficient for the results to be credible.
 Consider the past three years but not more than five years.
 First separate by product (group life and whole life).
 Divide data into homogenous groups: by age, gender, duration from entry, smoker
status, medical status, region etc.
 Ensure that there is enough data in each group to make the analysis for that group
statistically credible, otherwise groups will need to be combined.
 This is likely to be the case for the whole life data as this is a small portfolio.
 Calculate the crude mortality rate by taking the number of deaths divided by the
exposed to risk for each homogeneous group.
 Compare the results of the experience investigation with the mortality assumption and
standard mortality tables.
 Investigate whether there is any evidence of trends in the mortality experience.
 Also investigate any unusual circumstances that could have affected the mortality
experience.
iii.
Changes:
 There will be a need to consider doing more frequent experience monitoring (even if it
is not as comprehensive) as three years may be too long between investigations.
 There may be a need to add new factors to the mortality investigation, including
province or town, and to require appropriate information to be captured at claims stage.

 The impact of the pandemic on mortality may be measured separately to allow
comparison on a like for like basis.
 A better understanding of the unusual mortality experience and possible future trends
in mortality can be obtained by using information from new data sources.
 For example, from a government department keeping mortality, vaccination and
other statistics related to the incidence and severity of the disease.
iv.
Likely impact:
 The liabilities for the group life business in the current period may increase due to:
 Higher mortality rates.
 Delays in reporting of claims by policyholders or beneficiaries.
 Increases in the time taken by the insurer to pay claims.
 For example, due to pressure on the operations of the insurer due to high claim
volumes and the remote working environment.
 To the extent higher mortality is expected to continue, this should lead to a higher level
of liabilities for this business, even if claim settlement patterns return to previous
circumstances.
 The liabilities for the whole life product would increase if the insurer adjusted the best-
estimate of the mortality assumptions based on recent (and expected future) experience.
 The extent of liability increase depends on the allowance made for pandemic deaths.
 A prudent approach might assume indefinitely higher death rates.
 A best estimate approach would reflect a gradual normalisation of death rates.
 To the extent that margins have already allowed for a pandemic scenario, it is the
expected experience going forward relative to the assumptions and their margins that
will determine the impact.
 There may be an increase in liabilities and expected claims from a potential increase in
fraud or a reduction in effort toward rehabilitation in policies due to tougher economic
circumstances.
 Marks were allocated for other reasonable well justified points.
v.
Possible actions:
 Changes to premium rates:
 Consider whether policy conditions allow premium adjustments to existing
business.
 Consider premium increases for future business, and the impact on sales. For
example, if competitors do not increase their rates.
 Changes in underwriting and claims process:
 Consider whether factors such as vaccine take-up should be used in underwriting.
 Consider potential long-term consequences of having had the disease related to
the pandemic, or if excess mortality is linked to specific comorbidities, then
questions and/or tests associated will be added to underwriting.
 System changes might be needed to cater for changes to underwriting. For
example, to capture additional information.
 Changes to the underwriting and claims process could have an impact on the
reputation of the company or sales volumes.

 Consider additional exclusions. For example, conditions related to vaccination.
 Management may wish to make changes to the product mix or distribution method:
 If there is a view that the impact of the pandemic will be long lasting, then there
may be a view to increase focus on sales on some product lines, such as annuities,
and reduce the sale of others, e.g. group life cover.
 For a time, there could be a view to increase sales in geographies that are
anticipated to be less impacted by the pandemic and decrease sales on those where
the pandemic is anticipated to be more impactful.
 There could be a review of the reinsurance arrangements in place.
 This could be done to either obtain further guidance from the reinsurer or to obtain
more comprehensive or cost-effective solutions.
 Changes could be implemented immediately or implemented at a later stage
subject to further experience monitoring and testing.
 Changes to investments might be made. For example, greater weighting to cash and
liquid assets to meet the higher claims experience.
 Marks were allocated for other reasonable well justified points if they were linked to
impacts covered in part (iv).
Few candidates did consistently well in all parts of the question, with some leaving out one or
more parts of the question. Often, candidates did not list enough points given the mark
allocation.
In part (i) some candidates listed information related to with-profits policies or to group life
products which were not relevant to the question. A few also listed too much information
covering more than one method which did not score marks but used valuable time.
Most candidates who answered part (ii) in a structured fashion did well.
For part (iii) weaker candidates highlighted how the pandemic may impact the business or
the country rather than how monitoring of experience may change.
Weaker candidates listed too few points given the mark allocation in part (iv) and a few
candidates did not seem to understand how liabilities and reserving works.
For part (v) many candidates listed just actions and failed to give sufficient detail on these
actions. Many candidates listed more than the three actions.

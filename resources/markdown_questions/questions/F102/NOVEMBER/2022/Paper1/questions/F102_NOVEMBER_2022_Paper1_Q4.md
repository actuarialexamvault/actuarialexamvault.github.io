## QUESTION 4

A life insurance company has written significant amounts of unit-linked business in the last decade while its conventional with-profits book has seen a sustained period of lower new business sales. It has decided to close the conventional with-profits book, which currently has a healthy surplus, to new business, and to launch a unitised with-profits product range instead.
i. Outline the likely benefits to the company and to current and future policyholders, of the
company's decision.
[5]

A few years after the launch, the actuary performing an analysis of surplus notices that the per policy renewal expenses are much higher than expected in the pricing basis for the unitised with-profits contracts.
ii. Describe the investigations that could be conducted in response to this finding, and the actions
which might be taken related to the pricing and valuation bases following the investigations.

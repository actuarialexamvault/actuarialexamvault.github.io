## QUESTION 5

i. Define briefly what is meant by "actuarial funding".
[2]

ii. State the principles, other than fairness, that should be considered when designing the surrender
value terms for conventional life insurance products.
[6]

An insurance company is designing a single premium unit-linked endowment assurance contract, with a policy term of 15 years. The pricing actuary has determined that a fund management charge of 0.2% p.a. over the 15-year policy term should be sufficient to recoup the initial expenses incurred on this product (assuming policyholders do not surrender).
She is considering two surrender penalty designs, where the penalty on surrender at time t, measured in years from policy inception, is:

- A: 0.2% × (unit fund value at time t) × (15 - t).

- B: 0.4% × (unit fund value at time t) × (10 - t) for t < 10, and zero for t ≥ 10.

iii. Discuss these two designs with respect to each of the following:
a. Impact on the insurer's ability to actuarially fund units; and b. Fairness.

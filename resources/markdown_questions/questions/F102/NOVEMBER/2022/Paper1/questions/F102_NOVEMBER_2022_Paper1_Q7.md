## QUESTION 7

The insurance regulator of a country permits insurance companies writing unit-linked business to hold negative non-unit reserves, provided that certain conditions are met.
i. Outline briefly the conditions that may be specified by the regulator for the holding of negative
non-unit reserves.

An established life insurance company has been selling regular-premium unit-linked endowment assurances for a number of years. Benefits include:

- A death benefit equal to the higher of the unit fund or the guaranteed sum assured.

- A maturity value equal to the higher of the unit fund or a return of premiums paid.

- Surrender and paid-up values based on the unit fund less a fund-based surrender penalty. The company's actuary has just extracted policy data from the company's database to perform the annual valuation and prepare the company's financial statements including the balance sheet and income statement for the year. Accounting information and information from the fund manager have also been received for the preparation of the financial statements.

ii. List 4 items of accounting information and 4 items of fund management information that you
expect to have been received by the actuary.
[2]

iii. Outline briefly 8 data checks that could be done by the actuary to specifically check for
consistency between the policy data extracted, accounting information, and fund management information.
[4]

The actuary completes the valuation and notices that the non-unit reserves have changed from being negative at the last valuation to being positive at the current valuation. There have been no changes to the valuation method or assumptions, and you can assume that no errors have been made.
iv. Explain possible reasons for the change in the non-unit reserves.

The company is planning to expand its operations to a neighbouring country which is experiencing strong recent growth in demand for life insurance. All life insurance sold to date in the neighbouring country has been conventional without-profit business.
The company plans to launch a regular premium unit-linked whole life assurance policy in the new market with the following characteristics:

- Policy benefits: ➢ On the first of death or total and permanent disability (based on an occupational definition): The larger of a guaranteed minimum sum assured (selected by the policyholder at outset) and the value of units. ➢ On surrender: The value of units less a surrender penalty.

- The unit fund to be offered will be based on equities in the company's current home country.

- The only charges to be levied on the policy will be: ➢ Annual management charges; and ➢ Monthly benefit charges (in respect of any excess of the guaranteed sum assured over the value of units in the unit fund). Both charges will be variable at the discretion of the life office.

- Premiums are guaranteed for 10 years only at which point they may be reviewed.

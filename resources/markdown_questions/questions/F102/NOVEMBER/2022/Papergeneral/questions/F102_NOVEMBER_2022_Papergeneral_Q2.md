## QUESTION 2

i. Regulatory restrictions:
• There may be restrictions placed on premium rates or charges for certain
contracts.
• There may be restrictions on the types of contracts that may be offered.
• There may be restrictions on the terms and conditions placed on certain contracts,
e.g. restrictions on surrender value terms.
• There may be enhanced disclosure requirements.
• There may be restrictions on underwriting.
• There may be higher minimum requirements for statutory reserves, or there may
be restrictions on the amount of new business written through minimum solvency
requirements.

• There may be restrictions placed on the types of assets which may be held.
ii. Investments for the funeral business:
• The insurer will first consider the investments that match the liabilities by nature,
term and currency.
• The benefits are without-profits, making the nature of liabilities fixed in monetary
terms (whether level or fixed annual increases).
➢ Fixed interest bonds of suitable term are suitable for matching these liabilities.
➢ Government bonds are lowest risk, while corporate bonds may provide a
higher expected return for higher default and liquidity risk.
• Local currency assets are suitable for matching local currency liabilities.
• Funeral cover is usually short-medium term cover, and it should be possible to
find bonds of suitable matching term.
• Some liabilities will relate to the management expenses for this business, which
are mostly salary-related and therefore inflation-linked.
➢ Investments that produce expected real returns such as index-linked bonds
and perhaps equities and property may be suitable for these liabilities.
• Cash should be held as working capital and to meet short-term expenses and claim
payments.
• The extent to which investments can mismatch liabilities depends to a large extent
on the level of free assets of the insurer.
➢ The larger the level of free assets, the more investment freedom the company
has.
➢ Mismatching could be by nature, term, and/or currency, in order to maximise
returns for shareholders.
iii. Impact on sales volumes:
• Sales volumes of the savings contracts may drop as investors divert money to less
risky investment structures in the short term, such as bank deposits.
• To the extent that economic conditions deteriorate as a result of higher interest
rates, and result in higher unemployment, sales of most products, and in particular
savings type products, will suffer as premiums become unaffordable.
• The volumes of with-profits contracts may reduce by less than the volumes of
unit-linked savings contracts in the short term as the company will have the ability
to smooth bonus rates through volatile market cycles.
• The impact on the volumes of funeral insurance contracts should be negligible,
however, it depends on how employment levels are affected.
Impact on product profitability:
• A drop in the asset values of unit-linked contracts will reduce the fund-based fee
revenue of the company and therefore the product profitability.
• Sustained poor investment returns may lead to an increase in lapses for the unit-
linked contracts, reducing product profitability.

• Higher unemployment will most likely lead to higher lapses and lower sales,
impacting profitability negatively.
• Depending on the degree of matching and reserving methodology, a sudden drop
in the asset values may lead to reserves decreasing by less on some contracts, e.g.
whole life contracts, leading to losses.
• As funeral contracts have lower sums assured and require smaller reserves, the
impact on the profitability of these products should be negligible.
• As profits and losses are shared with policyholders of with-profits contracts, the
impact on the short term profitability of these products to the company is expected
to be muted.
iv. Risks:
• The internet-based distribution platform will sell to a different target market than
the adviser channels.
• The target market is likely to have a different underwriting experience, for which
the company may not have experience data.
• This data may be available through local reinsurers in the foreign market.
➢ However, the reinsurance terms may not be attractive, impacting product
margins.
• Clients purchasing insurance products through an internet-based platform are
likely to be much more price sensitive, reducing product margins.
• The company should consider what the competitor offerings look like through
similar channels in the developed country and how competitive their product
offering would be as this would impact product volumes and margins.
• The Life & Invest brand will not be well recognised in the new market, which
may negatively impact sales volumes, especially those of savings products.
➢ Higher costs may thus be incurred to market effectively and build credibility.
This could increase premiums and negatively impact sales.
• An internet-based sales channel may not be suitable for the company’s full range
of products, negatively affecting sales volumes
➢ It may be well suited to simpler products such as funeral products and with-
profits endowment products.
➢ It will not be suitable for whole of life products as the ability to underwrite
will be negatively impacted, leading to reduced margins through worse
experience.
➢ Savings products with complex charging structures or complex underlying
investment structures, such as unit-linked contracts typically sell better
through advised channels, where there is a better opportunity to explain terms
face-to-face for an investor.
Part (i) was a bookwork question and was well answered by most candidates.
Part (ii) was well answered by most candidates. A number, however, mistakenly indicated that
funeral liabilities would be long term and thus that bonds of a suitable term would not be
available.

Part (iii) was poorly answered by most candidates. Very few candidates referenced a diversion
of new business flows to competing banking products or recognised the fact that with-profits
policies would be mostly unaffected due to smoothing of returns and bonus levels.
Part (iv) was poorly answered by most candidates, as most were distracted by potential
administration issues or technical challenges that an internet platform may face, as opposed to
evaluating the basic risk factors associated with an insurance product.

## QUESTION 3

i. Factors:
• The model points should be chosen in such a way that they represent the mix of
expected whole life assurance business accurately.
• Specifically, you would want to ensure that there are model points from each of
the age bands shown in the product design.
• Each model point should represent a group of policies with similar features and
characteristics of the expected whole life assurance book.
➢ E.g. age of policyholder, sum assured applicable, different premium levels.
• Different model points would specifically be chosen, to allow for variations in
factors that directly affect capital requirements.
➢ E.g. mortality levels which differ by age and other underwriting factors such
as gender, smoking status, health status etc.
ii. Advantages of using a deterministic model for profit testing:
• The model should be relatively easy and quick to run for different premium levels
to assess the impact on our profit criteria.
• Different parameters can also be sensitivity tested/scenarios tested by re-running
the model to understand the sensitivity of profit towards different key assumptions
thereby getting a clear understanding of which parameters/assumptions cause
more risks to the profitability of the product.
• The time to build the model should be relatively quick compared to a stochastic
approach.
• Modelling mortality deterministically also makes sense as it is normally not
subject to large fluctuations as would be the case for say investment returns.
• A deterministic model would allow easier iteration to allow us to understand the
parameters better. (We could use this over time to test and calibrate a stochastic
model with less chance of then having a spurious outcome from a sensitive
parameter.)
iii. Description of model:
• The model would project all expected cashflows associated with a single policy
or model point up to some terminal age, for example 100.
• Cashflows should be projected on a monthly or annual basis.

• To calculate expected cashflows, allowance would need to be made for the
different decrements that could influence a potential policyholder, for example,
death, cancellation of policy or making it paid-up etc.
• Specific care should be taken at the ages when large changes occur for example
at ages 35 and 50 where a possible spike in cancellations could occur.
• The model should allow for all potential cashflows, such as:
➢ Premiums charged and the changes in premium rates over time (by age)
depending on the nature of the premium pattern/escalation pattern selected.
➢ Specifically, the premium levels would need to be flexible enough to adjust
in line with the sum assured changes if that is the intended design.
➢ Expenses associated with the product for example initial commission, upfront
distribution expenses, policy administration, premium collections, ongoing
client communication expenses etc.
• The model would need to be able to accommodate different premium levels for
which a profit metric is produced.
• The model output should align with the profitability metric decided upon, for
example, net present value of expected profit or internal rate of return, etc.
• A suitable risk discount rate will be used when calculating the net present value
of profit which considers the riskiness of the product, assumptions and the capital
requirements of shareholders.
• The model should allow for the build-up of reserves over time and capital
requirements including solvency capital and allow for a suitable cost of capital as
an outflow item.
• The model would then be run for the different model points that represent the
future expected new business sales for the company to produce a projected
income statement and balance sheet for the business.
iv. Premium pattern:
• If a level premium or fixed increasing premium is used:
➢ The premiums would need to be quite high initially (relative to the initial sum
assured) as large reserves will have to be built up.
➢ This might make the product appear expensive and unattractive to potential
policyholders.
• If premiums change in proportional to the sum assured:
➢ This might be difficult to explain to policyholders.
➢ This might result in high lapses, particularly at age 36.
• If premiums are age-rated with some link to sum assured:
➢ This would be even more complicated for policyholders to understand.
Part (i) was reasonably well answered. However, many students focussed on selecting model
points for conducting a valuation on existing business rather than for pricing a new product.
In part (ii) many candidates only focussed on the generic comparison of a deterministic model
versus a stochastic model and did not specifically apply their knowledge to the case at hand.
Only a few mentioned that the main variable impacting the price would be the mortality rates
which are relatively stable and hence a deterministic approach is sensible.

In part (iii) the candidates who described the cashflow model did fairly well. Many went into
lots of detail discussing how the assumptions would be set rather than describing the model
workings.
Only a few candidates scored well in part (iv). The majority focused their discussion on the
level of premium rather than the premium pattern.

## QUESTION 4

i. Benefits for the company:
• May bring the product in line with those of competitors or make it more appealing
in the market.
➢ This may lead to increased sales and profits for the company. As it could result
in designing a more appealing or easier understood solution to clients or
advisers,
➢ This would reduce the likelihood of new business volumes being insufficient
to cover the company’s initial expenses.
• The company may be able to implement charges that are more easily reviewable
• It may also be able to formulate new (and easier to achieve) policyholder
reasonable expectations.
• The company may be able to implement a more capital efficient product.
➢ E.g. reduce guarantees; or implement higher initial charges.
• The unitised with-profits product may increase operational efficiency
➢ E.g. The current administration systems, distribution and other processes for
unit-linked business may only require minor changes to cater for the new
product range.
Benefits to new policyholders:
• The new product is easier to understand and more transparent than the conventional
product.
➢ As fees are explicit and bonuses may be more easily understood in terms of
value of units
• There is usually less smoothing in unitised with-profits business, so it may be more
equitable to different cohorts of policyholders
• The company may be able to offer more choice, e.g. by level of risk/return trade-
off and level of guarantees.
• The lower level of guarantees compared to the conventional product may provide
greater investment freedom to pursue higher expected return investments leading
to better returns for policyholders.
Benefits to existing policyholders:
• Any accumulated surplus won’t be shared with new policyholders.

➢ This would result in a more equitable distribution to existing clients who
contributed to the surplus.
ii. Investigations and associated action:
• Investigate whether any mistakes were made in the initial analysis to determine the
actual expenses per policy (e.g. data used is all correct).
➢ E.g. Initial expenses misclassed as renewal expenses.
• Check for once-off items.
➢ If this is causing a distortion no remedial action may be required.
➢ However, anticipated once-off expenses should be accounted for in the
charging structure or bonuses.
• Check whether the deviation is significant in terms of absolute size.
➢ For a small book, no immediate action may be taken.
• Check whether higher expenses per policy are due to expenses exceeding the
expected level, or due to lower than expected business volumes, or both.
➢ Past budgets and business plans may be useful sources for comparing against
actual experience (expenses and business volumes).
➢ Higher-than-expected expenses should be investigated to identify specific
drivers and sources, and whether these can be managed in future, e.g. through
cost-cutting exercises.
➢ If business volumes are lower-than-expected then causes for this should be
investigated and whether this trend is likely to continue.
▪ E.g. higher than expected withdrawals or lower than expected new
business may have led to lower overall volumes.
• If the expense over-run is significant and costs cannot be reduced or volumes
increased:
➢ Pricing assumptions and charges will need to be updated.
➢ For new business and for existing business (if charges are reviewable).
➢ Valuation assumptions will be adjusted as necessary.
This question was generally poorly answered.
In part (i) many candidates used the terms unitised with-profits and unit-linked
interchangeably, without demonstrating an understanding of the difference between them.
Furthermore, some weaker candidates assumed that “closed to new business” meant that the
product was closed, and that the insurer had the right to use the surplus as it wished. Some
candidates incorrectly focussed on risks rather than the benefits of the company’s decision.
Often points made were too generic to gain credit.
In part (ii) only the stronger candidates used the context well, structuring enough points to
answer the question whereas weaker candidates either only listed (often incorrectly) the steps
in an expense investigation, or provided management actions not related to the pricing or
valuation bases (and often to elements like mortality or investment risk).

## QUESTION 6

i. Factors:
• The risks faced by the insurer.
➢ The greater the risks faced by the company related to the new product the
greater will be the extent of reinsurance needed.
➢ The larger the benefits offered and/or replacement ratios, the greater will be
the need for some form of reinsurance.
➢ A high degree of future benefit increases can result in significant risk, and
therefore a greater amount of reinsurance will likely be required.
➢ If the insurer is planning on entering a particularly risky target market, a greater
amount of reinsurance will be required.
• The experience of the insurer.
➢ As this is a new product the company is likely to need reinsurance as it will
have limited experience to draw on.
➢ If it has similar products this may reduce the need for reinsurance as it may
have relevant experience data to draw on.
➢ The extent of technical pricing assistance available from the reinsurer could
play a role.
➢ The more competent and experienced the insurer’s underwriting staff, the less
the need for reinsurance or technical assistance
• Reinsurance available in the market for this type of product.
➢ If there is nothing suitable available, it is a moot point.
• The cost of reinsurance.
➢ If the reinsurer wants to charge significantly more than the insurer’s estimate
of the underlying risk cost, hence making the product unmarketable, it may not
be able to use reinsurance.
➢ If reinsurance is perceived to be cheap the insurer may put more reinsurance in
place.
• Level of free reserves.
➢ The larger the free reserves the less need there may be for reinsurance.
• The insurer’s risk appetite.
➢ The more risk averse the insurer is, the more reinsurance will be required.
• The impact of reinsurance on solvency capital requirements.
➢ If reinsurance results in a significant reduction in solvency capital
requirements, the insurer may seek out a larger amount of reinsurance.
• The terms of reinsurance on offer.
➢ The more onerous the terms and conditions, the less likely the insurer will be
to take up reinsurance.
• Regulation may place requirements/limits on the amount of reinsurance to be used.
ii. Reinsurance programme:
• This will depend on the factors mentioned above.
• Quota share reinsurance as this will protect the insurer against parameter risk.
• Surplus reinsurance will protect the insurer from claims on the larger policies.

• Stop loss reinsurance (if available) could protect the insurer from overall poor
experience on the portfolio.
• Catastrophe cover could help protect the company from multiple claims arising
from a single event.
• The insurer may need to reinsure more than it would ideally like (quota share rather
than surplus, say) to get access to technical assistance from the reinsurer.
ii. Information from a standard application form:
• Height and weight;
• smoking and drinking habits;
• current health and details of any current treatment being received;
• personal medical history (any major illnesses or operations);
• family medical history (hereditary ailments like heart disease);
• occupation;
• potentially dangerous pastimes/hobbies;
• income; and
• assets and liabilities.
Part (i) was generally well answered by most candidates. Candidates scored well if they
identified which factors would have an impact on the amount of reinsurance sought out, as
well as identifying whether more or less reinsurance would be bought based on the factors
identified.
Candidates scored well in part (ii) if they were able to name the specific reinsurance
arrangements which would be appropriate.
Part (iii) was well answered by most candidates.

## QUESTION 8

i. a. Mortality and morbidity risk:
• The risk is that mortality and/or morbidity is heavier than expected and is not
covered by the benefit charges.
➢ This is of relevance when the unit fund is below the guaranteed
death/disability benefit.
• The risk is exacerbated because the company has no experience in the new
market.
➢ The extent of the risk will depend on how applicable the data used are.
➢ Assistance/data could be sought through a reinsurer.
• The risk will be higher if initial underwriting is not sufficient.
• Adequate allowance for the uncertain mortality/morbidity should be allowed
for in pricing.
• Reviewable charges should help mitigate the risk.
➢ However, the reviewable charges and premiums may encourage the office
to make unrealistically low estimates of future mortality in pricing and
reserving bases.
➢ It is not certain that the market will accept significant increases in charges.
• If mortality/morbidity experience is favourable, the office may come under
pressure to reduce benefit charges (and premiums at review).
• The disability definition, which is based on occupation, may exacerbate the
morbidity risk as it may be more subjective than one based on activities of daily
living.
• Anti-selection may be a problem if the reviewable premiums (only guaranteed
for 10 years) result in policies being cheaper than their conventional
counterparts for longer terms.
• If selective withdrawals from healthy lives are more than expected this would
also pose a mortality/morbidity risk.
➢ This is particularly so at the time of premium review.
• Small volumes of business, likely initially in a new market, would increase the
mortality/morbidity risk.
• Poor performance on the assets underlying the unit fund will exacerbate the
mortality risk (owing to there being a larger sum at risk).
b. Expense risk:
• The risk is that the expenses are higher than anticipated and not covered by the
management charge.
• The risk is exacerbated by the fact that there is a mismatch in nature, timing
and currency between the charges and the expenses.

➢ There is a risk that initial expenses might not be recouped if fund growth
is not as expected.
• The company is also exposed to the risk of inflation being higher than expected
on the administration and overhead expenses over the term of the policies:
➢ The extent of this risk will depend on how closely matched investment
growth is to expense inflation.
➢ Charges are fund-related and so might be expected to produce amounts
which beat inflation.
• The level of expenses will be uncertain because the office is entering a new
market with a product new to that market.
➢ E.g. admin. costs, development costs, marketing campaign costs.
• The costs of implementing premium reviews may not be known up front.
• Changes in the mix of business from that anticipated is also a problem as there
are likely to be cross-subsidies involved in the expense recoupment (between
policies with large & small unit funds).
• Lower than expected new business volumes, which is a significant risk in a
new market, may mean fixed expenses may not be adequately recouped.
• More withdrawals than expected may also result in overhead expenses not
being covered.
➢ However, the surrender penalty may reduce this risk.
• Reviewable charges can in theory protect the company.
➢ However, the company may not be able to review charges owing to factors
such as policyholder reasonable expectations and competitive pressure.
ii. Recouping initial expenses:
• Initial expenses will have to be recouped through the management charge as this is
the only charge (other than the benefit charge) on the contract.
• The management charge will thus need to be higher than required to merely recoup
renewal expenses.
• The additional charge could apply to all units or only to “Capital units” issued
during an initial period.
• In either case a unit-related surrender penalty will be required to recoup outstanding
initial expenses on early surrenders
• Under this approach actuarial funding can then be employed to reduce new
business strain, viz:
➢ Initially purchase fewer units than notionally allocated.
➢ Purchase the “missing” units over time from the future unit-related profits
(associated with the extra management charges on the units).
➢ A lower unit reserve is permissible because the full unit fund is only required
on death/disability, which thus reduces new business strain.
➢ The larger initial cash flow produced provides a better timing match for initial
expenses and reduces the company’s exposure to the investment risk.
In part (i) most candidates did not list sufficient points for the marks available. Some candidates
missed that even though premiums were not able to be reviewed for 10 years, charges were

able to be varied. As the question asked for an outline, marks were not awarded for simply
listing generic items such as parameter risk or anti-selection.
In part (ii) only the stronger candidates explained the method sufficiently.

## QUESTION 2

An actuarial student proposes using the "equating policy values" method when policyholders request altering their conventional without-profits whole life assurance policy to a conventional without-profits term assurance policy with the same sum assured. The policy value before the alteration would be set equal to 90% of the policy's asset share as at the date of alteration. The policy value after alteration would be calculated using the current pricing basis for new products.
Discuss the considerations that you would take into account in evaluating this proposal.

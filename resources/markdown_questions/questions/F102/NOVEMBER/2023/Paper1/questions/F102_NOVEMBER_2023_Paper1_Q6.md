## QUESTION 6

A medium-sized life insurance company in a developing market offers a wide range of unit-linked life insurance products. Recent changes in regulations allow life insurers to invest overseas, which had previously not been allowed. The office is planning to expand its range of products by launching a new (regular premium) unit-linked endowment assurance product with the following characteristics:

- Policy benefits:

- The death benefit will be the bid value of units.

- Surrender values will be equal to the bid value of units less a surrender penalty. However, on each 5th policy anniversary there will be a guaranteed minimum surrender value equal to a return of 75% of premiums paid.

- There will be a guaranteed minimum maturity value equal to a return of premiums.

- The unit fund to be offered will invest only in overseas equities.

- The only charge to be levied will be an annual management charge. The charge will be fixed at 6% p.a. for units issued in the first year and 1% p.a. on units issued thereafter.

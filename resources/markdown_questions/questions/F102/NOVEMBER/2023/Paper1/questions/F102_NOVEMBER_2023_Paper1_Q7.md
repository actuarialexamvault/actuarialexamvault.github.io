## QUESTION 7

i. List the 4 main types of underwriting.
[2]

A large life insurance company has a well-established book of risk business that is sold mainly through independent intermediaries. The company writes a significant number of policies on lives considered as non-standard risks with appropriate loadings to the premium rates. The loadings are also applied to the modelled mortality rate in the valuation.
ii. Outline the reasons that the company would accept non-standard risks.
[2]

iii. Outline the ways the company could monitor and manage the mortality risk associated with
such non-standard risks, other than through alternative underwriting decisions such as imposing exclusions.
[4]

The company recently performed a valuation of these policies. Upon investigation, an error was identified whereby the loadings for premiums and mortality were not applied and the standard rates for both were used in the valuation. The actual premiums being paid by sub-standard lives are correct.
iv. Outline how this error would have impacted the valuation results.

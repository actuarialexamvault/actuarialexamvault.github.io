## QUESTION 8

The government in a developing country has recently implemented new legislation relating to unitlinked retirement products. From the implementation date of the legislation:

- All future contributions to both new and existing unit-linked retirement products will be split into two parts:

- One third of all contributions will go towards a unit-linked "accessible fund" (AF). The policyholder will be able to access these funds at any time prior to the specified retirement age but will be restricted to at most one withdrawal per calendar year. At retirement, the accumulated value in the AF may be taken as a lump sum or used to purchase an annuity.

- Two thirds of all contributions will go to a unit-linked "retirement fund" (RF). The policyholder will not be able to access these funds prior to the specified retirement age. At retirement, the accumulated value in the RF must be used to purchase an annuity.

- Accumulated funds in existing unit-linked retirement products will, on implementation date, be transferred to the policyholder's RF.

- On death prior to retirement both the AF and RF are paid to the nominated beneficiaries.

Prior to this change, all contributions to unit-linked retirement policies had to be held by the insurer until retirement, at which time the unit funds had to be applied to purchase an annuity. Prior to retirement the only payments which were permitted were on death (equal to the full value of the fund) or after three months of unemployment (a once-off lump sum up to a specified legislated percentage of the fund).
i. Outline reasons why the government might have introduced this new legislation.
[5]

ii. Discuss how this legislation might affect an existing insurer in this market.
[6]

An insurer in this market is considering offering policyholders guaranteed annuity options. This will allow policyholders the option to lock-in annuity rates prior to purchasing their annuity at retirement if they annuitise with the insurer.
iii. Outline the advantages and disadvantages to the company of introducing this guaranteed option.

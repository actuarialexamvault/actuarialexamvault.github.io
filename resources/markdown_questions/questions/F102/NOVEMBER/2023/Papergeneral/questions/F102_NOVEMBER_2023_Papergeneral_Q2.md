## QUESTION 2

Considerations:
• It is unlikely that there is a significant risk of anti-selection for this type of
alteration.
• Offering the alteration protects the company against the risk of lapse-and-reentry
and therefore incurring new business costs again.
• Boundary conditions:
➢ Surrendering the existing policy and buying a new term assurance policy is a
boundary condition.
➢ Using the current pricing basis ensures that premiums are consistent with new
business premiums.
➢ However, consistency of the premiums is dependent on the surrender value
that is available for the whole life policy (under the boundary condition
alternative above).
• Policyholder’s reasonable expectations:
➢ If the alteration is consistent with the boundary condition, it is likely that
policyholder’s expectations are likely to be met.
• Affordability:
➢ Using 90% of the asset share for the policy value before alteration ensures
that the alteration is affordable (and some profit will be extracted).

➢ If the policy value before alteration is larger than the prospective reserve on
the original pricing basis, the company will not retain all of the historic
margins included in the original pricing basis.
➢ If the policy value before alteration is less than the prospective reserve on the
original pricing basis, then the company will also extract some of the future
profit it would have made on the original policy (in addition to the historic
margins).
➢ If the policy value before alteration is equal to the prospective reserve on a
realistic basis, then the company will extract the full profit it would have made
on the original policy.
➢ Using the current pricing basis for the policy value after alteration ensures
that the company will make future profit that is consistent with the current
new business margins.
➢ This proposal does not make any allowance for the cost of the alteration,
which could be deducted from the policy value before alteration.
➢ The initial expenses included in the current pricing basis should be removed
to avoid charging the policyholder again.
▪ At very early durations the asset share is likely to be negative. Including
a negative value in the alteration is appropriate because it means that the
initial costs of the original policy have not been recovered.
▪ However, using only 90% of the asset share when it is negative, means
that the company would not be recovering some of the initial costs
incurred on the original policy.
• Fairness – the company needs to consider:
➢ Fairness to the policyholders that alter their policies and those that don’t.
➢ Fairness to shareholders.
➢ If the policy value before alteration broadly extracts historic margins (only),
then it could be argued that this alteration is fair to the three parties.
➢ For very short policy terms under the new Term Assurance policy, the policy
value before alteration may be in excess of what is required to cover benefits
and expenses (without any further premiums being paid).
➢ It would thus be sensible for the company to specify a minimum term for the
term assurance policy in order to ensure reasonable value for money for the
policyholder.
• The surrender value before the alteration will not be consistent with that after the
alteration, as the term assurance is not likely to offer a surrender value.
• Stability over time and duration:
➢ Even though the new business pricing basis should not change frequently, this
method is unlikely to be stable over time as the asset share is dependent on
the actual experience (which may be volatile).
• Competition:
➢ The company needs to consider whether this alteration is consistent with
similar alterations offered by competitors.
• Legislative/professional requirements:
➢ This alteration would almost certainly be allowed in terms of regulation or
professional guidance.
• Small changes in term:

➢ If the term of the new term assurance policy is very long, then the premium
should be consistent with (and slightly lower than) the premium under the
whole life assurance policy
• Easy to explain:
➢ Equating policy values will be difficult to explain to policyholders, who are
unlikely to be familiar with present value calculations or asset share
calculations.
• Easy to document and administer:
➢ Calculating asset shares could be challenging to document and administer as
the historical experience must be captured.
➢ New business terms are readily available
This, fairly straightforward, question was generally poorly answered. Answers were too
generic, with generally insufficient application.
Most candidates knew the theory reasonably well and scored marks for the various headings
(boundary conditions, affordability, etc.), but few candidates could apply these to the question
scenario and make specific comments under these headings.
Very few candidates commented on the relationship between the policy value before alteration
and the reserve on the original pricing basis and the impact thereof on profit extraction.
Many candidates incorrectly indicated that using the asset share as basis for the policy value
before alteration would mean that the insurer made no profit at the date of the alteration –
seeming to ignore the fact that only 90% of the asset share was used as the policy value before
the alteration..
Many candidates incorrectly indicated that the amendment would cause selection against the
insurer and recommended underwriting to avoid this happening.
The following principles were not relevant to the scenario in the question and therefore did not
gain any credit: Consistency with premium at start; consistency with maturity values at end;
consistency with auction values.

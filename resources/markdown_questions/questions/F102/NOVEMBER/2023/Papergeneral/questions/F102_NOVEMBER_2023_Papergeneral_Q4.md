## QUESTION 4

i. Data checks:
• Reconciliation check on sums assured (SA):
➢ SA (end of the year) = SA (start of year) + SA (new business) – SA (lapsed)
– SA (paid)
➢ For 2022 (R m): 2300 = 2200 +550 – 150 – 300
➢ For 2023 (Rm): 2500 ≠ 2300 +600 – 75 – 250
• Lapses:
➢ Lapse rate = lapsed SA / start of year SA
➢ For 2022: R 150m / R2200m =6.8%
➢ For 2023: R 75m / R2300m = 3.3%
• Benefits:
➢ Benefits paid rate = paid SA / start of year SA
➢ For 2022: R 300m / R2200m =13.6%
➢ For 2023: R 250m / R2300m = 10.9%
• New business:
➢ New business rate = new business SA / start of year SA
➢ For 2022: R 550m / R2200m =25.0%
➢ For 2023: R 600m / R2300m = 26.1%
ii. Comments on data checks:
• The reconciliation check suggests either missing 2023 policy off-movements, over-
count of new business, or missing in-force SA at the end of the year (movements
suggest in-force of R2 575m at 31/12/2023).

• Lapses:
➢ The large year-on-year drop in lapse rate could suggest missing lapses in the
movements.
➢ Lapse rates should be compared to those expected (based on assumptions or
recent lapse experience investigation).
• Benefits:
➢ The year-on-year drop should be investigated, but may be reasonable and
should be compared to expected benefit payments (based on assumptions or
recent critical illness experience investigations).
• New business:
➢ The new business data does not seem unreasonable, but it should be compared
to new business plans, commission paid and new business premiums.
• The above checks should be supplemented with other checks (e.g. on number of
policies, premiums) and other data sources (e.g. accounts).
iii. a. Impact of an increase in claim administration expenses:
Liabilities:
• The impact will depend on how the experience will affect valuation
assumptions at 31/12/2023.
• Market-consistent expense assumptions are likely to be best estimates for the
company.
• If the change in experience is of a temporary nature, it may have no impact as
it does not impact valuation assumptions.
• If the change in experience is expected to be permanent, claim handling
valuation expenses should be increased, which will increase the value of
liabilities.
Capital requirements:
• If valuation assumptions are increased, risk-based capital requirements are
likely to increase as well.
• If valuation assumptions were not impacted, capital requirements will not be
impacted.
Free capital:
• Market-consistent value of assets is at market value.
• Free capital will likely reduce if valuation expenses are increased.
• Claim handling expenses are unlikely to make a significant impact on free
capital.

b. Decrease in claims:
Liabilities:
• Market-consistent assumptions are likely to be best estimates for the company.
• As the change in experience is expected to be permanent, valuation claim rates
from the condition should be decreased, which will reduce the value of
liabilities.
• The extent of the impact depends on how prevalent the condition is and the
impact of the new drug.
Capital requirements:
• The reduction in valuation claim assumptions is likely to reduce risk-based
capital requirements.
• The extent of reduction depends on the reduction in the level of uncertainty in
claims experience from this condition.
Free capital:
• Free capital will increase if valuation claim rates are decreased.
• The impact on free capital will depend on the prevalence of this condition.
In part (i) many candidates did not perform any checks as the question required. Explanations
of what types of checks should be performed, did not score any marks. The question asked for
quantitative checks not qualitative checks.
In part (ii) candidates who performed calculations in the previous question, scored well here.
However, those that didn’t perform any calculations couldn’t comment on the findings.
Part (iii) was generally well answered. Candidates who structured their questions as asked
(liabilities, capital requirements and free capital) generally scored well. A few commented on
the premiums, which was not asked (and thus did not score marks).

## QUESTION 5

i. Design considerations:
Meeting customers’ needs
• The insurer should consider how the product would meet customers’ needs
differently to the without-profits annuity.
• For example, the with-profits annuity may satisfy a need for increases based on
the performance of underlying investments, as opposed to fixed increases.
➢ This may provide higher increases but with greater risk and an associated cost.

Profitability
• A company will want to ensure that the rates charged will be sufficient to cover
the benefits to be provided and the expenses in most foreseeable circumstances, as
well as providing a profit margin.
• The profitability of the with-profits annuity should be similar to that of the
without-profits annuity, or material differences should be justifiable.
• Consideration should be given to the key influences on the sensitivity of profit to
changes in experience.
Marketability and competitiveness
• The benefits offered need to be attractive to the market in which the contract will
be sold. The with-profits feature may make the contracts more attractive.
• This needs to be balanced against the complexity of with-profits business and how
well customers will understand this product.
• The annuity market is typically very competitive and so the design, price and
bonus rates of competitors are key influences.
• Consider marketing material in terms of projections of bonus distributions and
whether this may result in unmet policyholder expectations in the future.
• Consider whether any guarantees should be offered to improve marketability.
Financing requirement and guarantees.
• With-profits annuity business should have low financing requirements.
• However, the design and communication need to consider how the insurer will
manage the bonuses and guarantees.
• The level of any regulatory or internal solvency capital required should be
considered.
• Consider how the bonus philosophy chosen will impact on the capital requirements
of the insurer.
Risk characteristics
• Consideration will need to be given to the acceptability of the level of risk
associated with the proposed product.
• The level of risk that may be acceptable will depend upon the company’s risk
appetite and risk management approach.
• A key risk is that bonus declarations do not meet PRE resulting in reputational
risk.
Extent of cross-subsidies
• The insurer needs to decide on the extent of any cross-subsidies between for
example large and small contracts.
➢ The marketing advantage of a simple premium structure may conflict with a
desire to avoid cross-subsidies.

Administration systems
• Some development of administration systems and other processes (such as bonus
declarations) may be required.
• Any development costs will need to be recouped in some way.
Consistency with other products
• Differences to the existing without-profits annuity should be justifiable and
marketable.
Meeting regulatory requirements
• The design should consider the need to adhere to any regulatory requirements.
➢ E.g. such as treating customers fairly.
Sustainability of investment options
• A company needs to consider Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
issues and the sustainability of the investment options.
• This may be constrained by the availability of suitable assets.
Distribution channel
• The insurer should consider the distribution channel that it will use to sell the new
with-profits policies.
• Sales representatives need to be trained in selling with-profits annuities so as to
avoid mis-selling.
Bonus distribution philosophy
• The insurer should consider what types of bonuses will be awarded.
• It will need to consider how profit deferral might be allowed for – if at all.
• It will need to determine how frequently bonus declarations will take place.
• It will need to consider how profits will be split between policyholders and
shareholders.
• It will need to consider its bonus smoothing philosophy.
Investment strategy
• The insurer should consider its investment strategy to enable it to provide a
reasonable level of bonuses in future.
• The level of free assets will determine to what extent the insurer is able to invest in
riskier asset classes in search of high returns.
• The investment strategy will also be impacted by any guarantees offered.

ii. Determining mortality assumption:
• An assumption is required for both the base mortality and the mortality trend.
• For base mortality, the company’s recent experience of the without-profits annuity
would be a starting point.
➢ Since the insurer is large, and the market developed, this experience should be
credible.
➢ However, this should be compared to any relevant industry or possibly
reinsurer tables.
• Adjustments will be required to allow for differences between the lives for which
the assumptions are being set and the lives from which the data is obtained.
➢ There may be differences in the target market or distribution channel for
example.
• An allowance should also be made for expected changes in mortality rates over
time, that is the mortality trend, using a combination of:
➢ Expectation approaches, involving expert opinion and subjective judgment to
specify a range of future scenarios;
➢ Extrapolation approaches based on projecting historical trends in mortality into
the future; and
➢ Explanatory approaches which attempt to model trends in mortality rates from
a bio-medical perspective.
• Deterministic projections might allow for different mortality improvement rates
according to year of birth cohort (as well as by age and gender).
• Alternatively, stochastic mortality projections can be used, such as the Lee-Carter
or P-spline method, although these may be challenging to calibrate.
• The assumptions should consider any applicable actuarial professional guidance.
Candidates typically performed fairly well in part (i). Strong candidates were able to consider
a wide range of product design considerations applicable to the scenario presented.
In part (ii) the candidates who clearly presented how the company would set both the base
mortality assumption as well as the mortality trend assumption performed well.

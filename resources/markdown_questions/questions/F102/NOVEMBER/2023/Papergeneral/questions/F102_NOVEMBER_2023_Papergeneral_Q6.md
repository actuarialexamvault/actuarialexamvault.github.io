## QUESTION 6

i. Customer needs met:
• Can provide a savings benefit, with exposure to the overseas equity market which
may provide attractive returns.
• The overseas investment can offer diversification from local investments.
• The guaranteed maturity value, albeit only a return of premiums, can protect
against poor investment performance at maturity .
• The surrender value can provide access to funds for other purposes during the
policy term.

• The guaranteed minimum surrender values can protect against poor investment
returns during the term of the contract and may allow surrender on financially
favourable terms at those points.
• Although the benefit may vary depending on market returns, it allows for a benefit
on death of the policyholder that may be more than the sum of the premiums.
ii. a. Investment performance:
• The office will need to be able to meet the investment guarantees if overseas
equities perform poorly in local currency terms.
➢ As this risk will be difficult to match, the insurer may hold a provision for
the investment guarantee, but the risk is that this provision is inadequate.
• The risk is significant as the guarantees apply during the policy term in addition
to applying at maturity.
• There is an indirect impact on profitability as poor returns will lead to lower
management charges than anticipated, possibly resulting in expenses not being
recouped.
• As all charges are unit related, the risk could be significant (as the charges may
be vital for profitability).
• Poor investment performance will lead to unhappy policyholders and bad
publicity and a competitive disadvantage.
b. Expenses:
• The risk is that the expenses are higher than anticipated and not covered by the
management charge.
• The risk is exacerbated by the fact that there is a mismatch in nature, timing
and currency between the charges and the expenses.
➢ There is a risk that initial expenses might not be recouped if fund growth
is not as expected.
• This is exacerbated due to the fact that the level of charges is fixed and not
variable at the discretion of the insurer.
• The company is also exposed to the risk of inflation being higher than expected
on the administration and overhead expenses over the term of the policies:
➢ The extent of this risk will depend on how closely matched investment
growth is to expense inflation.
➢ Charges are fund-related and so might be expected to produce amounts
which beat inflation.
• The level of expenses will be uncertain because the office is launching a new
product (admin. costs, development costs, investment costs, marketing
campaign costs).
➢ In particular, the costs relating to overseas investment may be difficult for
the insurer to estimate, never having invested overseas before.
• Changes in the mix of business from that anticipated is also a problem as there
are likely to be cross-subsidies involved in the expense recoupment (between
policies with large & small unit funds).

• Lower than expected new business volumes, which is a significant risk with
this new product unfamiliar to the market, may mean fixed expenses may not
be adequately recouped.
• More withdrawals than expected may result in overhead expenses not being
covered.
➢ However, the surrender penalty may reduce this risk.
c. Withdrawals:
• There is a risk of higher withdrawals than expected at early durations, before
initial expenses have been recouped.
• Other than at the guaranteed surrender value points, the surrender penalties
should provide the insurer with some protection against withdrawals being
higher than expected.
• There may be financial selection against the company at the guaranteed
surrender value dates if unit performance has been poor.
Part (i) was generally well answered, with better solutions outlining needs met by each of the
key features of the product.
Part (ii) was not as well answered. Only stronger candidates provided well-structured points
for each of (a),( b) and (c), taking account of the context and the specifics of the product
benefits. Aside from a shortage of distinct points, weaker candidates made several errors, often
writing much content for little marks. Some of the content not scoring marks included listing
generic risks not relevant to the product (such as high guaranteed death benefits, or
mismatching assets and liabilities), giving mitigations (which were not asked for in the
question), rewriting the same points in different ways, providing generic difficulties with
offshore investment, or providing aspects they believed were not risks for the given product.

## QUESTION 7

i. Forms of underwriting:
• Medical underwriting
• Financial underwriting
• Lifestyle underwriting
• Claims underwriting
ii. Reasons why the company may accept non-standard risks:
• Since the company has a well-established book of risk business, the company might
have the experience and appetite to take on the additional risk.
• If no other companies in the industry are accepting non-standard risks, the company
can provide cover to policyholders that might have been declined otherwise.
➢ This will help the company to gain market share and broaden its offering to the
market.

➢ This could be based on a gap in the market that the company identified and
decided to target this market.
• It may create bad publicity were the company not to accept such risks.
• The company will allow for the additional risk in the premium it charges to
policyholders that are considered non-standard. If the charges are appropriate, the
company is likely to make a profit from these policyholders.
• This will be in line with the objectives of the company which would be to make
profits for the shareholders.
iii. The company could manage the risk through:
Experience investigations:
• The experience investigation will be a key control to ensure that the experience is
tracking in line with expectation.
• This will be used as part of the pricing basis as well as the valuation basis.
• If the experience is not tracking in line with expectation, the company can change
the rates to ensure that the loadings are still appropriate.
Analysis of Surplus
• This will identify sources of profits or losses over a reporting period from these
non-standard policies.
• Certain risks might have volatile experience or continuously result in losses. This
will help the company identify which non-standard risk might not be worth selling.
• This will also link back to the experience investigation and might provide areas
where the company needs to place more focus on assessing experience.
Reinsurance
• Reinsurance will also be a useful tool in managing the risks associated with the
non-standard policies.
• Since the company is large and well established, it might not want to share the
parameter risk with the reinsurer through a quota share arrangement.
• However, the insurer might provide cover for large sums assured and therefore, a
surplus / excess of loss arrangement might be quite useful.
• Some form of aggregate or catastrophe cover may be suitable, for example to
protect against adverse experience caused by a pandemic (as non-standard lives
may be more susceptible than standard lives).
• Reinsurance rates may also provide an indication of the adequacy of the insurer’s
pricing in combination with its underwriting practices. If reinsurers are not willing
to provide cover at reasonable rates this may indicate that the insurer is not
adequately pricing for these non-standard risks.
Other
• It would be important to continuously feedback the results from the above items
into the actuarial control cycle.
• The company would need to continuously monitor the experience and the financial
impacts from offering these non-standard policies.

• If experience turns out to deviate, the company should take proactive action to
correct this.
iv. Impact on the valuation:
• The loadings are used to determine the premium rates and the mortality rates.
• This would have resulted in the present value (PV) of premiums being understated
(the modelled premiums would have been lower than the premiums actually
charged).
• The PV of mortality payments would have also been understated (the expected
number of deaths would have been understated due to a lower modelled mortality
assumption).
• The net impact would depend on how the loadings on premiums compare to those
used in the modelling.
• The impact on profits emerging between valuation dates depends on whether the
same error was made in the valuation at the start of the period.
• There would have also been second order impacts on expense, reinsurance and
capital modelling, which would have mainly been a function of the number of
policies in-force and the mortality outgo.
Parts (i) and (ii) were generally well answered. Some candidates made generic points such as
“regulation”, which did not score many marks.
The quality of answers for (iii) varied significantly. Stronger candidates managed to generate
more valid points, and also considered the context in which the company was operating. Many
candidates simply listed the general underwriting decisions from the notes, which did not score
any marks.
Part (iv) also had a broad range of answers. Many candidates did not read the question or did
not answer how the valuation results were impacted. Candidates that considered the present
value of premiums and benefits scored well.

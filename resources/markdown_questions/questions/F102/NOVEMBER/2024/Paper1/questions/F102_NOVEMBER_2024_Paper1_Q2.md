## QUESTION 2

A life insurance company recently launched a new conventional without-profits whole life assurance policy with an accelerated critical illness benefit for the first time.
It has been proposed that existing whole life assurance policyholders should be allowed to add an accelerated critical illness benefit to their policies. The alteration would be carried out using the "equating policy values" methodology, with the policy value before the alteration being calculated using the original pricing basis and the policy value after the alteration being calculated using the current pricing basis.
Discuss the considerations that should be taken into account in evaluating this proposal.

## QUESTION 8

A life insurance company operates several internal unit-linked funds. Unit prices are calculated daily.
All the funds are expanding, and therefore are priced on an offer basis.
i. State the basic equity principle as it applies to the pricing of an internal unit-linked fund and
explain the rationale behind it.
[3]

ii. Describe how this principle is applied when determining the appropriation and expropriation
prices for a fund.
[2]

The following details are for the Equity Fund as at the end of 31 March 2024.
Market value of assets (excluding cash) within the fund = R50 000 Cash balance in the fund = R1 000 Number of units = 10 000 Selling costs of assets in the fund = R1 500 Purchasing costs of assets in the fund = R1 100 The market value and cash balances allow for current assets and liabilities of the fund and any accrued income or tax adjustments.
There is an initial charge of 3%. All offer and bid prices are rounded to three decimal places.
Prices are calculated at the end of 31 March 2024, and applied to new requests for investments or disinvestments received during that day.
iii. Calculate the following in relation to this fund, stating any assumptions you make:
a. Appropriation price. b. Expropriation price.

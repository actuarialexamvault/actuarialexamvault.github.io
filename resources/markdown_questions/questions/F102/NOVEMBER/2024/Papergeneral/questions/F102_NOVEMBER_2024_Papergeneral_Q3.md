## QUESTION 3

i. Reasons for monitoring experience:
• To develop earned asset shares.
• To update assumptions as to future experience
➢ For both pricing and reserving.
• To monitor any adverse trends in experience to take corrective actions.
• To provide management information.
ii. Possible reasons for losses:
• A key reason for losses could be that the outgo from company expenses allocated
to the unit-linked endowments exceeds the income from policy charges.
• Usually this arises when expenses are relatively fixed whereas policy charges are
variable.
• This can be due to various reasons, such as:
➢ Poor investment returns reducing the fund-based charges received.
➢ Lower new business volumes than expected, leading to less income relative to
fixed acquisition expenses.
➢ Higher exits than expected (such as surrenders).
➢ Overly generous surrender values (or insufficient surrender charges).
➢ Higher than expected expense inflation.
➢ Unexpected once-off costs.
➢ Higher than expected dealing costs.
• If unitised with profits, where the insurer shares in the investment profits, then
lower than expected investment returns will give rise to losses.
• Losses from new business (due to new business strain) could exceed profits from
existing business (e.g. if the book is relatively young).
• There may be too many expenses allocated to the product, e.g. due to an error in
the analysis.
• The pricing may have been aggressive (low charges), in order to attract business.
• If there are high levels of sums assured, there could be mortality losses, for
example due to:
➢ Inadequate risk charges.
➢ Higher than expected deaths (for various reasons including pandemics and
catastrophes).
• Default of a reinsurer (if reinsured).
• There could be an error in the analysis.
• Cross-subsidies assumed in pricing between bigger and smaller policies not
coming to fruition.
iii. Different expense types:
• Initial/acquisition costs (other than commission) if such costs are spread over
some period after sale.

• Renewal/maintenance.
• Investment.
• Claims (of all kinds).
iv. Expense investigation process:
• Get total company expenses over a past recent period, say the last 12 months or
previous financial year.
• Remove any expenses deemed not relevant, such as once-off costs or shareholder-
only costs.
• Sub-divide the expenses by type:
➢ Initial.
➢ Renewal.
➢ Termination.
➢ Investment.
➢ Overheads.
• Further sub-divide or allocate each of the above into the different product
groupings, specifically the unit-linked endowments.
• If deemed necessary, these can be further split between single and regular
premium contracts.
• Consider if any of the resulting ‘cells’ of expenses are too small to be credible.
➢ If so, group these small cells pragmatically with other cells.
• Expenses are allocated to ‘cells’ based on an analysis of expenses by department
or function:
➢ Staff expenses may need to be subdivided between cells by the use of
timesheets.
➢ Property expenses can be allowed for by charging a notional rent to each
department in proportion to the floorspace occupied, and then allocated to the
different cells in proportion to the department’s salary costs.
➢ New computer costs can be spread over their future expected lifetimes and then
allocated to departments in proportion to usage.
➢ Investment costs would be subdivided by asset class and usually allowed for
by a reduction in yield for each class.
➢ One off capital costs would be spread over the expected future lifetime of the
item, then treated as an overhead.
➢ Pragmatically allocate overheads e.g. in proportion to the split of direct
expenses.
• Check that all expenses are accounted for, that is nothing relevant lost in the above
process.
• Calculate per-unit expenses by dividing the monetary amount of expenses in each
cell by the relevant denominator (such as number of policies or total sum assured
or total unit funds), eg:
➢ Per policy for initial and renewal.
➢ Per unit sum assured for underwriting expenses (e.g. if material and not
included in initial).
➢ Termination expenses may be per policy or percentage of unit fund value.
➢ Percentage of unit fund value (or funds under management) for investment.

• Consider the expected future per-unit expenses given the insurer’s plans over the
business planning horizon, and adjust the above as necessary (other than for
inflation).
• These best estimates may need to be adjusted to include a margin for prudence.
➢ The size of any margin incorporated will depend on the legislation and
accounting principles governing the preparation of those accounts in the
country concerned, and the degree of risk associated with the parameter.
Examiner Comments
This question was largely bookwork and was answered well by most candidates. Candidates
that did not know their bookwork well, were unable to score well.
Part (ii) of the question was answered well by candidates who were able to apply their
knowledge of a unit linked product in suggesting potential sources of experience loss.
Weaker candidates tended to produce vague and unstructured answers for part (iv).

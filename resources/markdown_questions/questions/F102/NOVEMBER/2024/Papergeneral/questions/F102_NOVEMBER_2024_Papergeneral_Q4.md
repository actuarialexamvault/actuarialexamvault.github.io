## QUESTION 4

For part (i) many candidates could not generate enough points to score well. Too many
candidates treated this question as an assumption setting question, instead of describing how
the market consistent value of the endowments would be calculated.
Candidates also missed easy marks on the risk margin – the compensation that a third party
would require for taking on the uncertainty in these liabilities.
In part (ii) plenty of candidates missed that the illiquidity premium would be the difference in
the discount rate. Candidates that picked this up and described that annuity cash flows are
longer dated and more predictable than endowment cash flows, scored quite well.

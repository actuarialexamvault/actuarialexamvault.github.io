## QUESTION 5

Part (i) required candidates to distinguish between the savings profit and insurance profit
given their different treatment.
For part (ii) some candidates confused the question and instead wrote about why the insurer
should have chosen the additions to benefit method.
For parts (iii)-(v) the candidates that did well were those that generated more points specific
to the circumstances (product, developing country etc.) whilst candidates who performed less
well made very generic points and did not discuss the situations when equity investment
would/would not be appropriate.

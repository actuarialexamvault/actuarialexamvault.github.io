## QUESTION 6

i. Reasons for analysing surplus:
• To show the financial effect of divergences between the valuation assumptions
and the actual experience, exposing which assumptions are the more financially
significant.
• To show the financial effect of writing new business.
• To provide a check on the valuation data and process, if carried out independently
• To identify non-recurring components of surplus, thus enabling appropriate
decisions to be made about the distribution of surplus to with-profits
policyholders.
• To give management information on trends in the experience of the company.
• To comply with regulatory requirements.
ii. Possible reasons for mortality profit:
• Mortality profit arises when the actual mortality experience over the period is
better than that expected in the assumptions used at the start of the period.
• We would expect to see a mortality profit when the assumptions are prudent, such
as in supervisory reserves.
• The sophisticated underwriting could be particularly effective in rating
individuals and minimising anti-selection, whereas the valuation assumptions do
not reflect this.
➢ For example the valuation assumptions could be at a more aggregate or prudent
level.
➢ Or the assumptions could ignore the selective effect of the underwriting.
➢ Or the class of lives that are attracted to this product are better (in terms of
mortality) than assumed.
• The insurer's dynamic pricing model could incentivize policyholders to maintain
healthier lifestyles, and this could lead to lower claims than expected and a
subsequent profit.
• There could have been overall improvement to underlying mortality not yet
reflected in adjusted premiums.
• It could be due to random fluctuations or seasonality (particularly if the period of
investigation is very short).
• There could be an error in the analysis of surplus.
• Efficient claims management practices could also contribute to a mortality profit.
More thorough investigation of claims and effective fraud detection than allowed
for could result in fewer illegitimate claims paid out than anticipated.
iii. Data required for mortality investigation:
• Benefit start date.
• Benefit cease date (if applicable).
• Date of birth or age at entry.

• Count of actual death claims reported in the period.
• Can use either, or both, of benefit count or sum assured for the above.
➢ If using the sum assured, then this would be needed at each date if this
potentially varies over time.
• Identifiers in order to group the data into relevant homogeneous groups, typically
the rating factors applied in the pricing.
➢ In particular whether standard or non-standard.
iv. Factors to consider when reviewing valuation mortality assumptions:
• The insurer may not adjust its valuation assumptions, for example if:
➢ The period over which the analysis of surplus was too short.
➢ The amount of surplus was small.
➢ The mortality investigation revealed no material change to underlying
mortality.
➢ The financial effect of changing the assumptions is not material.
• The insurer would consider the results of the mortality investigation, assuming
this covers an appropriate time interval and gives credible results.
➢ In particular, how the experience has changed compared to the current
mortality basis.
• Consider whether to create its own mortality tables or to adjust standard tables.
➢ Given the niche nature and the techniques used, it would seem unlikely that
standard tables could even be suitably adjusted.
• Expected future mortality experience over the valuation projection period.
➢ May consider trends if the projection period is particularly long, or if the trends
show worsening mortality.
➢ Would typically ignore mortality improvements in term assurance valuation.
• Consider if there are any regulatory requirements or accounting standards that
apply, such as the inclusion of margins.
• May consider mortality experience from reinsurers or industry, although these are
less likely to be applicable given the nature of this insurer.
Examiner Comments
Part (i) was generally well answered.
Part (ii) was reasonably answered. A common issue was that candidates did not relate their
comments to the specific scenario in the question. Many candidates also commented that the
company was selecting good lives as a result of the underwriting process. While this may well
be true, they will only make a profit if the lives selected are better than expected.
The marks for part (iii) were generally good, but too many candidates did not consider that
for a mortality investigation the deaths and the exposed to risk are required. A list of rating
factors only received limited credit.

Part (iv) was poorly answered. Many candidates listed the factors that need to be considered
when setting an assumption. Few candidates considered the situation given where there is
already an assumption and an investigation in place.

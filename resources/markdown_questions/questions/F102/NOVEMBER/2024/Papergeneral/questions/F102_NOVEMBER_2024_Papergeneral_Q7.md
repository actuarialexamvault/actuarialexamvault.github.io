## QUESTION 7

i Why use a cash flow approach:
• The cashflow approach will allow for the complexity of the product, e.g.:
➢ multiple lives insured;
➢ multiple projected decrements (death and withdrawal).
• In particular it will also allow the company to investigate the sensitivity to profit
due to:
➢ mortality variance;
➢ variations in average numbers of children insured; and
➢ children’s ages.
• A cashflow approach allows the measurement of the expected return that the
providers of capital will receive.
• A cashflow approach will allow for the projection of both statutory reserves and
capital requirements.
• A cashflow approach will allow flexibility to model country A and X together or
separately.
➢ The cashflow method may be easier to allow for the different mortality in the
two countries.
➢ The cashflow method can allow more easily for different lapse rates in the two
countries.
• The company may wish to allow for stochastic decrements or decrements that may
vary over time.
➢ It is unlikely that stochastic investment returns will be required since this is a
protection policy.
➢ However, mortality could be projected stochastically.
➢ Similarly for lapses which will impact per policy expenses.
• A cashflow method allows the modelling of interdependencies between variables
➢ and the link between the variables and economic conditions.
• A cashflow method will allow the company to model projected birth rates since
newborns are automatically insured.
➢ It will also allow this to be varied with factors such as the economy if the
company wants to model it.
• The risk discount rate can take account of the term structure of interest rates.
• Tax and reinsurance will be easier to allow for.
ii Setting model points:
• The data from Country X may not be useful for the model point data and the
company may need to use risk factors to determine model points.
• They may approach the government /reinsurer /census bureau in Country A to
determine birthrates and family dynamics to estimate the likely spread of the
number of children to be covered.
• For the areas which do not have high child mortality in Country A the experience
from Country X may be useful to set model points with appropriate adjustments.

• For mortality the company could use groupings by:
➢ number of children ;
➢ age of children,
➢ sex of children;
➢ policyholder’s ages;
➢ region.
• Allow for likely volumes of sales and expected birth rates.
Examiner Comments
Overall candidates did not score well on this question.
For part (i) some candidates described the kind of assumptions needed for a cashflow model
rather than why the company should use a cashflow method. Some candidates wasted time
explaining how to build a cashflow model which did not score marks.
For part (ii) many candidates followed a standard bookwork approach which generated some
points (e.g. the grouping by rating factors) but then failed to address issues like how to get
data for the model points. Some candidates wasted time explaining the characteristics of
model points.

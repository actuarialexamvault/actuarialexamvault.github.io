## QUESTION 8

i. The basic equity principle of unit pricing for an internal fund is that the interests of unit
holders not involved should not be impacted by the transaction.
Rationale:
• For unit holders the only prices relevant are those at which they buy units in the
fund
➢ and those at which they redeem their units.
• In theory, the movement in price between those two events should only reflect the
performance of the assets backing the unit
➢ and charges deductible under the policy provisions.
• Price should not be affected by creation or cancellation of other units,
➢ otherwise, cross-subsidies between unit holders will arise.
ii. Application of the basic equity principle:
• The basic equity principle is only achievable if the amount of money put into the
fund, or taken out of the fund, is such that the net asset value per unit is the same
before or after appropriation.
• Appropriation price is this amount of money when creating a unit.
➢ It preserves the interests of existing policyholders.
• Expropriation price is this amount of money when cancelling a unit.
➢ It preserves the interests of continuing policyholders.
iii. a. Appropriation price:
MV of assets (excluding cash) = R50 000
Cash balance = R1 000
Total fund value = Market value of assets + Purchasing costs of assets
= 51 000 + 1 100 = R52 100
Appropriation Price = R52100/10000 = R5.21 per unit
b. Expropriation price:
Deduct sales costs from appropriation price total fund value
Fund value = 51 000 – 1 500 = 49 500
Expropriation Price = R4.95 per unit
c. Offer price:
Assumes continuing on an offer basis
Offer price = appropriation price plus initial charge
Offer price = R5.21/0.97 = R5.371 (rounded) per unit

Examiner Comments
For part (i), the majority of candidatesknew the basic equity principle. However they did not
score well on the rationale and how to apply it to the question.
Similarly on part (ii), the majority of the candidates struggled to apply the principle and
instead just stated the definitions of the expropriation and appropriation prices (which was
not what the question asked).
For part (iii), candidates struggled with the calculation of the different prices. Candidates
who scored well showed the detail of their calculations. There was some confusion regarding
the selling costs and the purchasing costs and when to use which. Some candidates only wrote
down final values, which meant they did not score well due to not being able to obtain method
marks.

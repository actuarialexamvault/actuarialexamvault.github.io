## QUESTION 2

- Surrender value: Bid value of units, with surrender penalties reducing to zero over 10 years.

- Investment funds: Choice of five externally managed funds ranging from cautious to aggressive.

- Initial underwriting: Online health declaration only; no medical tests for sums assured below a threshold.

- Charging structure:

- Initial charge: 3% of premium.

- Annual fund management charge: 1.2% p.a.

- Monthly policy fee: R50, deducted from the unit fund. Due to increasing competitive pressure, the company is considering the following product changes:

2. Allow annual withdrawals of up to 10% of the fund value without penalties.
3. Replace upfront charges with a 0.75% p.a. annual fund management charge increase to recover
acquisition costs over time.
4. Launch a "guided fund selector" robo-advice tool to assist policyholders in selecting
appropriate funds.
5. Outsource policy administration to a third-party service provider.

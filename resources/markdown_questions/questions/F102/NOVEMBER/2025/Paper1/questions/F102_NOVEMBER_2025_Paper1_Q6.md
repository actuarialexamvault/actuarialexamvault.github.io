## QUESTION 6

An insurer in a developing country has been selling without-profits immediate annuities for a number of years. Annuitants can choose between level annuity payments and payments which increase annually at a fixed rate.
The insurer is considering adding a with-profits immediate annuity to its current offering. The payments may be increased by annual bonuses declared using an "additions to benefits" approach. The intention is for annuity increases to be at least equal to local Consumer Price Inflation (CPI).
i. Explain possible reasons for the company considering offering the new product.
[2]

ii. Discuss the types of investments that the company might use for matching the liabilities of the
new product.
[5]

The insurer instead decides to offer a without-profits immediate annuity that is guaranteed to increase at CPI for life.
iii. Explain the 2 key risks to the insurer of offering this product.
[3]

The insurer also sells unit-linked endowment assurances with guaranteed annuity options (GAOs) that are purchased at policy inception and can be exercised at maturity. The insurer wishes to extend its GAO offering to include the option to effect the new CPI-linked without-profits immediate annuity at maturity.
iv. Explain how the insurer could use market option-pricing techniques to estimate the expected
cost of this GAO.

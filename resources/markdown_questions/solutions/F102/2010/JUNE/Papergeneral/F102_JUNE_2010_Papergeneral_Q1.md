## QUESTION 1

(i) An offer pricing basis is the pricing basis used when the company is a net creator of
units.
Under this basis, both the bid and offer prices are based on the appropriation price, i.e.
the total cost of creating a unit.
A bid pricing basis is the pricing basis used when the company is a net canceller of
units.
Under this basis, both the bid and offer prices are based on the expropriation price, i.e.
the net receipt when cancelling a unit.
(ii) May be advantageous if:
· The life office loads for lower trading expenses than would be incurred by an
investor investing directly in the underlying market (where they will pay for trading
on the purchase, and again on the sale, of the asset).
· The life office may be using a favourable pricing basis at the time of paying the
premiums and receiving the benefit, e.g.
Ø If units are bought and sold under the same pricing basis i.e. both
appropriation/expropriation price), the policyholder is effectively not paying
trading expenses on the underlying asset
Ø If they buy units under a bid basis and sell under an offer basis, they actually
gain.
· It may also be the case that the trading expenses paid by the life office, as a large
investor, may be lower than those that an individual policyholder would pay if
trading in their personal capacity.
· There may be tax advantages of investing through a life office.
· These gains need to be offset against the other initial/renewal charges which the
life office is likely to have that would not be incurred when trading directly in the
underlying assets.

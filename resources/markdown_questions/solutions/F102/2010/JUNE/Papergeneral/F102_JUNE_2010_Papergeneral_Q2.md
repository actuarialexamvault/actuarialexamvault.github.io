## QUESTION 2

(i) The bonus philosophies should not have a direct effect on the asset shares, since asset
shares comprise actual cash flows (which bonus declarations are not).
The general principle applied by both companies would be to bring the final benefit payable under a policy (i.e. initial sum assured plus all bonuses) broadly in line with the earned asset share for the policy.
The low and stable reversionary bonuses imply that Company A distributes most of the surplus as terminal bonus, so would use asset shares primarily to decide on terminal bonuses.
Company B distributes more of the surplus over the life of the policy. It therefore needs to monitor asset shares more closely when deciding on reversionary bonuses, to ensure that the sum assured plus reversionary bonuses is close to, but does not exceed, asset share on maturity.
(ii) Company A:

- By weighting terminal bonuses more heavily, they are delaying the distribution of profit for as long as possible.

- This frees up capital, so that the company is able to pursue a less constrained investment strategy.

- This in turn should lead to higher expected returns, which can then be passed on to policyholders in the form of higher benefits.

- Smaller risk of company insolvency. Company B:

- By distributing more of the profit as it arises, policyholders have greater certainty about the final benefit that they will receive.

- This may assist in their financial planning

- as well as greater protection against a fall in the market, since previously declared bonuses are guaranteed.

- Fewer cross-subsidies.

(iii) Under revalorisation, bonuses are granted by a % increase in reserves (and usually the
same % increase in premiums and benefits).
It is common to divide the surplus between the investment surplus, most of which would be distributed to policyholders, and surplus from other sources, which may be entirely for shareholders.
Since the surplus is distributed as it arises (with little or no deferral), this method is more similar to the philosophy of company B.
Further, the ppn of the surplus to be distributed is specified upfront.

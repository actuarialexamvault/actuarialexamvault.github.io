## QUESTION 3

(i) Principles:

- The reserves should cover all liabilities arising from all contracts.

- The reserves should be calculated prudently, allowing for all relevant liabilities (incl. all guarantees and options).

- The reserves should take credit for future premiums if these are contractually due to be paid.

- The valuation should be prudent, not best estimate, and so the basis should contain margins.

- The valuation of the liabilities should be consistent with that of the assets.

- Appropriate approximations or generalisations may be allowed.

- The interest rate used for calculating the reserves should be chosen prudently, taking into account the currencies, yields and reinvestment yields on the assets.

- The demographic, withdrawal and expense assumptions used should all be prudent, taking into account the type of insurance and country of residence, but the expenses can be on an ongoing business basis.

- If no explicit allowance is made for future bonuses then they must be allowed for implicitly by a suitable adjustment to the valuation interest rate.

- If the valuation method itself defines the amount of expenses assumed (eg the net premium method) then the amount implied must be no less than a prudent estimate of the relevant expenses.

- The valuation calculations conducted over time should not suffer discontinuities arising from arbitrary changes to the basis, however

- The basis should be active and appropriate to current circumstances.

- The valuation method used should recognise the emergence of profit appropriately over the policies' lifetimes, so as to match the assumed future regular bonus.

- Valuation bases and methods should be disclosed.

(ii) Market-consistent valuation:

- The rationale for such valuations include the emergence of finance-related products, e.g. index-linked products, and that the approach allows comparability of results as the method is less prone to subjective margins or manipulation.

- In such an approach future unknown parameter values are generally set to be consistent with market values, where such a market exists.

- In theory the market-consistent value of a liability is the price that someone would charge for taking on the responsibility for the liability, in a market in which such liabilities are freely traded.

- In the absence of such a market, an approximate approach will need to be taken.

- Future investment return:

- Base on a future risk-free return irrespective of assets held (rather than a riskfree rate for gilts plus a margin for equities).

- The argument being that, in the long term, the equity margin should also be combined with an increased risk of not achieving the increased yield - the net result being the risk-free rate of return.

- For the immediate annuities:

- Project expected cash flows, allowing appropriately for mortality.

- Then, either: § Value these cash flows (as if they were known and certain) as the maturity proceeds of a series of zero-coupon "risk-free" bonds of matching terms. § i.e. devise a portfolio of assets whose cash flows replicate those of the liabilities, and then the current market price of this "replicating portfolio" will be the market-consistent value of the liabilities.

- Or: § Equivalently we could produce the (same ) market-consistent valuation by discounting the cash flows at current risk-free rates of interest. § The appropriate discount rate to achieve this would be the market yield on such bonds.

§ Different discount rates can be used for discounting cash flows at different durations if necessary to reflect current market yields.

- The risk-free interest rates (or equivalently the market values of the replicating asset portfolio) may need adjustment for any short-term anomalies in the market at the present time.

- Extrapolation of market prices will be required for interest rates that fall beyond the maturities observable in the market.

- Mortality:

- There is unlikely to be a highly liquid active market for mortality risk, so it is not possible to determine a unique and objective market-consistent mortality assumption.

- Instead, the mortality assumption is likely to be set by reference to industry statistics, internal experience investigations and information from reinsurers.

- The assumption should include appropriate allowance for future mortality improvements.

- Appropriate margins will need to be included, reducing the mortality rate, to allow for uncertainty.

- Expenses & inflation:

- The expense assumption might be determined by reference to expense agreements available in the market, for example from third party administration companies,

- as well as from industry statistics and features specific to the company's own experience.

- The difference between the current market yields of equivalent fixed-interest and index-linked bonds gives an indication of the market's expectation for future inflation.

- Include a mismatching reserve if assets were not perfectly matched to liabilities, and the assumptions should be based on "best estimates" increased by appropriate margin to allow for uncertainty.

- Possibly also provide for an operational risk reserve.

(iii) Supervisory reserves & solvency capital are normally included because:

- The requirement for statutory reserves and solvency capital will often result in an initial capital strain.

- There will therefore be a need for capital from external sources e.g. shareholders (in a proprietary office) or with profit policyholders (in a mutual).

- The providers of the capital will normally want a return on this capital e.g. risk discount rate and this is conveniently allowed for in a cashflow model.

- The profit flows will be altered, and the ultimate profitability will be impacted by this need for further financing.

- The requirement for capital may restrict a company's capacity in other functions of its development and on-going operations

- e.g investment strategy may be restricted by size of free assets.

- These components will be particularly important when completing model office projections into the future to identify calls on capital in the future.

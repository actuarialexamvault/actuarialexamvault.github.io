## QUESTION 5

(i) Appropriate level of retention
· Analyse your in-force book of business to determine the distribution of expected claims, e.g.: Ø the average sum insured (& whether policies have sum insured increases built in) Ø type of policy (whole of life or term assurance) Ø average age of policyholder, smoker status, etc. · Decide whether your future new business is likely to be similar to your in-force business, and if not what impact this will have on your risk. · Investigate how appropriate the existing level of reinsurance has been, · and how profitable it has been for the reinsurer. · Speak to the board to get an indication of its appetite for risk. · Analyse the level of the company's free assets (high free assets would support higher retention limits) · Ascertain the importance attached to stability of its free asset ratio (this could reduce the freedom provided by the free assets) · Ascertain the confidence (& familiarity) of your company in the underwriting of the book of business - the more confident it is the less the need for reinsurance. · Establish how competent the company's claims department is at identifying invalid claims. · Determine the terms on which reinsurance can be obtained (incl. any profitsharing) - as price is obviously a factor to consider in determining your retention.

Ø and the dependence of such terms on the retention limit (it may be possible to vary retention limits slightly to take advantage of favourable rates) Ø the existence of a profit-sharing agreement in the treaty

· Check the impact on the company's regulatory capital requirements of increasing the retention limits. · Perform a stochastic simulation to obtain probabilities of total loss, for example, using retention strategy X the company should only suffer losses of more than x once every y years. · Attempt to determine the likely impact of the various options on expected profitability. · Also consider the opinions of the reinsurer, as they should have experience in this regard.
(ii) Which reinsurer to choose
· Ability (capacity) of reinsurer to provide the required cover. · Since there is some cost to changing reinsurers, how well has your existing reinsurer served you over the last five years. · Any past knowledge/experience of other reinsurers. · Should you go with only one reinsurer (administratively simpler) or more than one (more access to expertise, and keeps reinsurers on their toes) · Cost of reinsurance from each company will be a key factor. · What expertise is each reinsurer willing to bring to the table. · Does any reinsurer have a particular expertise in your target market. · What terms and conditions does each reinsurer impose, e.g. underwriting and claims referral limits, onerous administrative conditions. · The financial strength of the reinsurer. · Do the reinsurers offer profit sharing, and at what level. · Is the reinsurer in the same city as you. If not, is this an issue.

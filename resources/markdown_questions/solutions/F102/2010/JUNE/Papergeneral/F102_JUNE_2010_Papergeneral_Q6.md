## QUESTION 6

(i) Principles:
· Consider any legislative requirements/restrictions and market practice in the country. · The company will want to ensure that its surrender value scales are affordable.
Hence, on average, the maximum surrender value would be the asset share (after deducting the costs of the surrender). · The company should treat withdrawing and continuing policyholders equitably.
Ø Thus on surrender of a non-profit contract the office may try to recoup the same amount of profit as it would had the contract not been surrendered - this is not always possible (or desirable). · The values should be consistent with policyholder's reasonable expectations (PRE). This could include: Ø consistency with quotations at outset Ø reasonableness of early surrender values relative to premiums paid Ø running smoothly into maturity values (which may on occasion involve paying more than asset share - which should only be done where absolutely necessary owing to the principle of affordability) Ø having regard to competition and auction values (if any) · Practical Issues: Ø the method should be simple to apply and easy to explain Ø the scale should not change too frequently owing to the administrative work involved

Ø anti-selection should be avoided, and surrender values should take account of financial conditions Ø surrender values, in conjunction with new business premiums, should not encourage lapse and re-entry Ø surrender values should be stable, i.e. small differences in policies should produce small changes in surrender values Ø whether any "blending" is required between the old and new surrender values
(ii) Why would a policyholder want to make a policy paid up
· They can't afford the cover anymore, but they don't want to lapse the policy and have no cover. · They may not need the full sum insured anymore (circumstances may have changed) but reduced cover is adequate.
Why would an insurer permit this · They want to prevent the policyholder surrendering completely, and thus will continue to make some profit on the reduced sum insured. · They still have the policyholder on their books which may allow them to do further business with them in future. · As the policy remains in-force it reduces the impact of selective withdrawals. · It avoids the insurer having to realise assets at an inappropriate time.

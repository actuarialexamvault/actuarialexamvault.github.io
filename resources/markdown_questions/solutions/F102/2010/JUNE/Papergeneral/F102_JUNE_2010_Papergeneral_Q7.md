## QUESTION 7

Question 7 Possible reasons: · Experience may have been better than expected (i.e. a positive experience variance). · Substantially more new business sold in the year. This will add to the value of in force provided the business is profitably priced. · A change in valuation basis. Changes in basis assumption may result in an increase in the value. For example, higher assumed investment return may result in higher future margins and hence a higher value of in force. · Reduction in the discount rate used. The lower the discount rate used to calculate the value of in force, the higher the value will be. · Exchange rate movements. A weakening of the local currency will result in a higher value of in force of off shore business.

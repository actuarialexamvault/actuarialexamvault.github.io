## QUESTION 8

- Many candidates failed to write enough to get good marks. Question 9:

- In (i): No credit was given for items which only indirectly impact design/distribution, e.g. investment, reserving, solvency, etc.

- In (ii): No credit was given for statements such as "term assurance is a protection policy and so policyholders won't expect a surrender value". It is not clear, particularly in a new market, what policyholders might understand or expect from a particular policy.

- In (iii): Many candidates seemed unclear that risk is related to the unpredictability of items (e.g. mortality, expenses) rather than their absolute level per se. Candidates were penalised for making blatantly incorrect statements, e.g. "as there is no withdrawal benefit there is no withdrawal risk".

- (iv) & (v): Fairly well answered on the whole. Possible Solutions Question 1

(i) An offer pricing basis is the pricing basis used when the company is a net creator of
units.
Under this basis, both the bid and offer prices are based on the appropriation price, i.e. the total cost of creating a unit.
A bid pricing basis is the pricing basis used when the company is a net canceller of units.
Under this basis, both the bid and offer prices are based on the expropriation price, i.e. the net receipt when cancelling a unit.
(ii) May be advantageous if:

- The life office loads for lower trading expenses than would be incurred by an investor investing directly in the underlying market (where they will pay for trading on the purchase, and again on the sale, of the asset).

- The life office may be using a favourable pricing basis at the time of paying the premiums and receiving the benefit, e.g.

- If units are bought and sold under the same pricing basis i.e. both appropriation/expropriation price), the policyholder is effectively not paying trading expenses on the underlying asset

- If they buy units under a bid basis and sell under an offer basis, they actually gain.

- It may also be the case that the trading expenses paid by the life office, as a large investor, may be lower than those that an individual policyholder would pay if trading in their personal capacity.

- There may be tax advantages of investing through a life office.

- These gains need to be offset against the other initial/renewal charges which the life office is likely to have that would not be incurred when trading directly in the underlying assets.

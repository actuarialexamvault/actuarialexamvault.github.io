## QUESTION 9

(i) Possible contract design regulations:
· Types/designs of policies permitted · Max/min premiums/charges · The requirement for certain benefits such as surrender values or paid-up values which are not common on the intended contracts · Prevention of certain exclusions Possible distribution regulations: · Distribution channels which may be used · Commission levels · Minimum broker training and registration requirements · Advertising restrictions · Certain key information (or advice) which must be provided to policyholders or potential policyholders · Restrictions on benefit illustrations · Cooling-off periods

(ii) Reasons why withdrawal benefits are unlikely:
· Term assurances have low reserves, as there are no maturity values and only death benefits need to be reserved for, and so there is little scope to pay worthwhile withdrawal benefits. · Such a benefit would increase the risk of selective withdrawals. · Offering such a benefit would increase withdrawal rates, which reduces profitability · Premiums would need to increase if additional benefits were to be paid, reducing the effectiveness of the product as the cheapest form of life cover.
(iii)(a) Mortality:
· the risk is that the office underestimates mortality · this is the most significant risk for these term assurance products · the office has no experience in this particular market and so needs to source appropriate assumptions elsewhere, e.g. from a reinsurer · underground mining is hazardous, making it more difficult to estimate mortality · the extent of the risk will depend on how applicable the data used are · the lack of underwriting will add to the uncertainty in estimating mortality · anti-selection may be a risk owing to the lack of underwriting · selective withdrawals are also a risk · accumulations of risk, e.g. insureds all exposed to a single major underground incident, or from living in high-density housing Expenses · the risk is that the expense loadings are too low · the level of expenses will be quite uncertain because the office is entering a new market (admin. costs, development costs, etc.) · commission structures will be known and can be loaded for · owing to the uncertainty associated with new business volumes, it will be difficult to load for fixed expenses accurately · changes in the mix of business (e.g. between larger & smaller policies) from that anticipated is also a problem as there are likely to be cross-subsidies involved in the expense recoupment · the costs associated with premium collection may be significant, and may increase above price inflation · higher than anticipated inflation may be a big concern as the terms of cover may be very long and expenses are likely to constitute a major part of the total premium · with small policies there may come a time when expenses exceed the premium being collected Withdrawals: · the greatest risk of loss is associated with early withdrawals when asset shares are negative · even though no withdrawal benefit is provided this can be a significant risk · withdrawal rates may be higher than expected, and more difficult to predict, due to: Ø policyholders being financially unsophisticated and thus more likely to buy something which is not ideal for them, or may be unaffordable Ø premiums being collected weekly in cash

· the decreasing nature of the benefit (and level premiums) means that near the end of term the value of future premiums may exceed the value of future benefits, implying that the office will lose profits from withdrawals at that time and that such withdrawals are likely · the company has no experience of withdrawal rates in this market which exacerbates the risk · higher withdrawals than expected will mean higher per policy expenses for policies remaining in force
(iv) Market share may be being lost due to:
· Premiums may have become uncompetitive · May not have the "bells and whistles" on their contracts which competitors have, e.g. conversion options · More, or more effective, marketing by other companies · Competitors may offer sign-up gifts or loyalty programmes · May pay lower commission than major competitors · The company may be focusing its efforts on other products · Reputation for inefficient admin (to deal with policy queries, etc.) · Reputation for inefficient payment of claims · Their target market may have low average disposable income and may be less able to afford assurance under present economic conditions · Underwriting may be stricter than competitors' underwriting · Loss of reputation in the market, e.g. scandal · May have smaller free assets than major competitors and thus appear more insecure · May not be in a position to expand new business: Ø may not have sufficient capital, or Ø may not have the staff/systems to handle expansion without jeopardising service levels
(v) Possible actions:
· consider whether premiums can be reduced as non-profit term assurance is sold almost entirely on price · expense savings may be made, e.g. reduce commission · reduce the profit required per policy in order to sell more · may even consider selling policies at a loss to increase market share, e.g. if the market is at the bottom of a cycle · reinsurance may offer attractive risk premiums which could allow the term assurance premiums to be reduced · reduce the level of underwriting (e.g. review medical limits) to improve costeffectiveness and marketability · introduce "bells and whistles" to distinguish product in the market, for example include a conversion option to a savings contract at the end of the term · introduce sign-up gifts or loyalty programmes · increase commission rates in order to make more sales · introduce more (or more effective) distribution channels · increase advertising budget, e.g. improve brand awareness · consider ways to expand target market, e.g. such as the current proposal · improve after sales service and staff training to improve name and reduce lapses · reinsurance may offer financing on good terms, which could provide capital for expansion if this was a constraint

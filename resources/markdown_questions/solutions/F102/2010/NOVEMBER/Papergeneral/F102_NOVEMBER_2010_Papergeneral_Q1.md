## QUESTION 1

This question was generally poorly answered. It was not an underwriting or an investment question. Risk results from incorrect pricing. Targeting a market with lower longevity does not help if your pricing is wrong.
No credit was given for:

- Underwriting and then reducing benefits for healthy lives as this is not really an option.

- Don't offer surrender values

- Limiting age to which payouts will take place

- Targeting a lower risk market if it was not accompanied by a statement on differential pricing.

- Monitoring if it was not accompanied by what will be done with the results. Suggested solution:

- Keep up to date with mortality trends

 - Own experience

 - Industry research

 - Medical advances

 - Ensure pricing is up to date

- Include appropriate margins

 - and allowance for improvements

- Reinsure (if they can get a reinsurer to take the risk)

 - Would also need to consider the costs

- Consider different annuity rates to different groups

 - Will need to underwrite

 - Significant product development costs

 - Will also affect the costs of the "normal" annuities as poorer lives are now removed from the population

- Limit the amount sold

 - Will also limit potential profit

- Sell with-profit or unit linked annuities

 - Under with-profit, share risk with policyholders

 - Under unit-linked, risk is passed on to the policyholder

- Monitor what competitors are doing to avoid selection against your company

- Mortality bonds, swaps, derivatives

 - If company is big enough and can incur costs

 - Try and hedge by selling insurance products to same market 2

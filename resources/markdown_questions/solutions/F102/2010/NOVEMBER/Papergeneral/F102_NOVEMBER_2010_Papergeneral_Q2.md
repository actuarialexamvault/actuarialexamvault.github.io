## QUESTION 2

Part 1 was generally well answered.
Students did not cover the non-unit reserves as part of the liabilities at all, leading to extremely poor marks in questions (ii) and (iii). In part (iii) many students wrote about solvency in general and not about the specific situation in the question.
In Part (iv) students needed to give the detail to get any marks for option pricing techniques. Vague statements as found in the notes without application to the situation scored no marks e.g. the cost of the guarantee is the benefit that is paid less the benefit that would have been paid if there was no guarantee.
Suggested solution:
(i) Advantages

- A policyholder in poor health does not have to buy a life annuity

- Allows the opportunity to transfer remaining capital to his dependants

- Can choose level of income as part of financial plan Risks

- Pension not guaranteed for life - money could run out

- Investment risk - need to disinvest when the market is down

(ii)

- For the unit linked liabilities

 - invest in the underlying assets as per the policyholders instruction

- Non-unit liabilities

 - Reserves need to be set up as recoveries will reduce over time

 - Assets backing the liabilities are mainly for the future expenses

 - Invest in real assets

 - Index-linked bonds or equity

- Unlikely to need cash as long as the company is still selling

(iii)

- There will be no effect on the assets backing the units as the liabilities will also have fallen by 25%

- The assets backing the non-unit liabilities may have fallen by 25%.

- In addition, the future income from the fee on assets has decreased significantly.

- The costs which it needs to cover, will not have fallen. These are fixed and increasing with inflation (or something similar).

- Some of the free assets are also likely to be in equity - reducing free assets too

- Solvency will thus decrease 3

(iv)

- Mortality (and thus age and gender) can be ignored - essentially an investment guarantee

- Identify an appropriate stochastic model providing rates of return on investments

- Generate investment scenarios for the projection period allowing for the underlying assets

- Project asset values for each scenario

- Check the value of the pension payable and compare with the guarantee

- If the guarantee is more than zero, record this

- Don't discount - will add a margin or discount to the start of the year at the appropriate rate from the scenario based on investments in which the premiums for the guarantee will be invested.

- Repeat for the remainder of the months

- Repeat and calculate the cost for each of a large number of scenarios (say 10000)

- Determine the average cost per scenario to find the expected cost

- alternatively can use the distribution of costs to set price

- Decide on margins to include to establish the price

- Will have to differ for different risk profiles in the investments

- Can also use option pricing

- 11 European put options

 - on underlying assets as chosen by policyholder (or something similar)

 - Strike price is the level in the first month

 - and exercise date is the date the pension is payable

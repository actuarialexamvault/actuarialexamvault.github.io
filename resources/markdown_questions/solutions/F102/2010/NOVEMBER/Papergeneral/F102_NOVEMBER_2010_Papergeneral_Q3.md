## QUESTION 3

The question tested student's ability to apply a number of concepts: capital management, with-profits structures and earnings. A broad understanding of the syllabus was thus needed. The question was poorly answered overall. Strong candidates noted some of the practical implications.
(i) Most students missed that the long term reversionary bonus rates are linked to
the long term investment return. Only a few students picked up that the improved embedded value reflected improved future profitability and would not be available for immediate distribution Suggested solution:

- Reversionary bonus rates will be determined taking into consideration the company's long term investment return assumptions

- Long term investment return should be able to support the reversionary bonus rate 4

- The low interest environment may have decreased long term assumptions, resulting in a decrease in the reversionary bonus rates declared.

- Bonus rates may be in line with competitors

- If the company has solvency difficulties there may be regulatory pressures on bonus declaration management

- Even if interest rates have not fallen, the assets would have fallen during the recession without a corresponding decrease in the reserves, decreasing the free surplus available. It is likely that this will be absorbed by the terminal bonus but if this is not sufficient to absorb the decrease in free assets this may have also necessitated a decrease in the reversionary bonuses declared.

- The company will be smoothing bonuses so improved free assets may not translate to increased bonuses

- Maintaining the higher reversionary bonus rates increases the guarantees and reserves under the contract affecting solvency.

- If profitability not sustainable surpluses may be deferred to terminal bonuses

- This will further reduce capital further decreasing investment freedom and ability to write new business.

- The company may be avoiding changing RBE

- The company may have changed bonus philosophy

- The increase in embedded value reflects an increase the present value of future profits which will only be available for distribution in future years.

(ii) (a) Most students identified the need for better capital management but missed the
issues surrounding a decreasing with profit book and increasing unit linked book as a possible reason for demutualisation Suggested solution:

- The company is likely to be experiencing capital strain:

 - It is small and so is unlikely to have a large capital base

 - The recent increase in sales is likely to increase the capital requirements to meet new business strain

 - This will constrain the investment freedom of the company.

 - The recession is likely to have decreased the value of assets whilst the declared bonuses have been guaranteed and liabilities are thus unlikely to have decreased for the with profits products. This would reduce the free surplus.

 - The company has probably exhausted other efficient sources of capital i.e. loans and financial reinsurance

 - The low interest rate environment and recession are likely to have increased the cost of guarantees and options decreasing the free assets.

- Demutualising will allow the company to raise capital from shareholders

- The with-profits book is experiencing poor sales. Profits from the growing unit linked book have to thus be distributed amongst a smaller group of policyholders. 5

- As the with-profits book diminishes, capital for new unit linked business sales is likely to come from in force unit linked business. As the with-profits policies no longer contribute to funding new business strain on the unit linked business, distributing the surplus to the with-profit policyholders may be considered as treating customers unfairly

[b] Mainly bookwork question on how to distribute profits with additions to benefits.
The implications on the bonus declarations of having a decreasing with profits book and increasing unit linked book was missed.

- The company could increase the reversionary bonuses

- The company could calculate the liabilities on higher reversionary bonuses so as to eliminate the free surplus

- This will however increase the guarantees on the book as the bonuses are declared reducing the free surplus and investment freedom

- The company could declare a once of special bonus

- This would avoid changing policyholder reasonable expectations as it can be clearly attributed to the distribution of the free estate due to the company closing to new business

- This will increase guarantees faster than with reversionary bonuses

- The company could distribute the surplus via terminal bonuses

- This will avoid creating guarantees and maximize free surplus

- The company will need to account for when the profits on the unit linked business will emerge and be available for distribution

- If the profit is expected to emerge after the with-profits products have gone off the book, complications will arise

- The company may have to consider selling the business or merging with another fund as it will become too small to manage

## QUESTION 4

This question was mostly bookwork, but a significant number of students were not able to score well as they did not know their work.
A number of students elected to discuss the bases for the more general alteration of policies, rather than the specific bases for making a policy paid-up. No additional marks were earned for this.
The last section required the students to think but from the thoughts that emerged a number of students did not properly read the question. The question stated that the paid-up policy value was a "realistic prospective value". Any profit that would emerge in the future could only be the difference between actual experience and that anticipated in the basis, which is expected (by definition) to be zero. 6

Suggested solution:
(i)

- The basis needs to be such that the conversion to paid up is affordable and can be supported by the earned asset share.

- Should be consistent with the projected maturity value, allowing for premiums not received.

- Should be consistent with other alterations such as surrender values.

- Surrender value should be consistent before and after alteration to avoid lapse and re-entry.

- Basis should result in paid up value that is consistent with any information disclosed at a new business stage in line with policyholder's reasonable expectations.

- Paid up rates offered by competitors should be considered in setting the basis.

- Basis and any changes should be documented clearly.

- The calculation should be simple to understand for explanation to the policyholder and administrative capability.

(ii)
Proportion Method Equating Policy Values Method Description - Sum assured adjusted by - Value of the contract before proportion of premiums alteration on prospective or paid over total premiums retrospective basis can be payable equated to a prospective value after alteration.

Advantages - Simple to calculate and for - Can produce consistent policyholders to understand surrender values before and

- Blends into maturity value after alteration

- For increase in benefit/extension of term can be done on the current premium basis in line with new business

- Method is stable is basis is same before and after alteration

- Affordable depending on basis used. Disadvantages - Too high at short durations - Does not necessarily avoid

- will not recover high lapse and re-entry initial expenses

- To low at medium term as not taking into account investment returns

- Unlikely to be consistent with surrender values

- Inconsistent with competitors 7

(iii)

- If a realistic prospective value is used for surrender the difference between the earned asset share and the surrender value will be the full expected profit under the unaltered contract.

- If a realistic prospective value is used to calculate the value of the contract after alteration, no further profit is expected from the date of alteration.

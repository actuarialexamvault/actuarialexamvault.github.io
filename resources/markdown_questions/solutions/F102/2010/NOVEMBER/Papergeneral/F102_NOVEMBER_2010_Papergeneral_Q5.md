## QUESTION 5

Many students suggested that the underwriting needed to be competitive. The question did make it clear that the life insurance industry had not been established in the country concerned and consequently the issue of competition would therefore not arise.
Furthermore only a few students were able to deduce that pricing of the product would also not be subject to any competition. This would allow the pricing to be conservative and reduce the need for any underwriting other than basic statements of good health.
This type of thinking would also apply to any reinsurer who was prepared to accept risk and consequently there would be little requirement to satisfy the reinsurer's need for strict underwriting.
If the student missed these two points their approach to this question would have been flawed.
Overall parts (iii) and (iv) of the question were poorly answered.
Most candidates regurgitated text from study material. In these cases points that were irrelevant were stated, e.g. with-profits bonus declarations.
A large portion of candidates had no reference to the detail in the question. Easy marks were missed.
Incomplete statements did not get marks, e.g.'More underwriting is needed because risk increased' instead of 'More underwriting is needed because risk increased due to antiselection'.
A number of candidates stated the liabilities must be valued at the risk discount rate as opposed to expected investment return (or risk-free rate was also accepted).
Suggested solution:
(i)

- No company data.

- No industry data.

- No competition so premium rates can be include large margins.

- offer limited premium guarantees that are reviewable with short-notice.

- offer short-term contracts such as term assurance, rather than whole life.

- rather offer compulsory insurance on a group scheme basis than individual policies.

- must be simple to administer, so limited bells and whistles. 8

- no-medical underwriting, rather a declaration of health, questionnaire or something similar.

- first option is to have either a accept or reject policy, second option is to have exclusions. Exclusion may be more onerous to administer.

- underwriting at claim stage.

- premiums charged possibly by age bands, not too worried about gender.

(ii)

- reinsurer may have experience in a similar territory.

- could assist with setting risk rates.

- may be able to advise on distribution strategy.

- possibly give input to likely lapse experience.

- will not do it for free and will require participation in risk.

- sum's assured are low so individual surplus reinsurance not appropriate.

- catastrophe reinsurance is required.

- possible stop loss reinsurance to limit overall loss.

- proportional reinsurance will be appropriate.

- possibly quota share arrangement that is generous in the reinsurer's favour.

- include a profit share arrangement.

- financial reinsurance an option to assist with setup cost.

- risk premium reinsurance is also an option, but may more complex and expensive to administer.

- reinsurance commission is required to cover expenses.

- as experience builds over time reduce the ceding percentage.

- will be on a treaty basis.

- legal risk may arise

(iii)

- there may be a lack of legislation for reserving and solvency capital.

- use similar territories approach.

- first principles.

- no past data for mortality and lapses so initially use the pricing parameters.

- would not like to recognise profit prematurely.

- principle of prudence.

- company will have proportionally large set-up costs.

- these may not be appropriate for expense assumptions.

- approximate methods may initially be appropriate.

- IBNRs.

- alternatively use a retrospective build up of reserves.

- retrospective build up should be on a gross premium method.

- allow for reinsurance.

- eliminate any negative reserves.

(iv)

underwriting approach:

- historical data for mortality and lapses will form the basis.

- target market may be different for high sum's assured.

- income of policyholders may be higher and may therefore have access to better housing, medical facilities and education.

- mortality experience may be lower.

- selection may be more of an issue due to the high sum's assured.

- better informed policyholders may select against company.

- medical underwriting may be required.

- especially for disability benefit.

- financial underwriting would be required to check policyholder income vs benefit

- additional exclusions are applicable for disability benefit.

- more options may be offered to sub-standard lives, such as premium loadings or more exclusions.

- specialists test may be required, this may not be available in developing country.

- for disability claims underwriting will need specialist skills.

- access to medical reports essential. reinsurance:

- individual surplus reinsurance.

- facultative reinsurance for very large sum's assured.

- no history for disability, may require a lower retention.

- for disability risk premium reinsurance may be more appropriate.

- ideally mortality and disability should be on the same basis.

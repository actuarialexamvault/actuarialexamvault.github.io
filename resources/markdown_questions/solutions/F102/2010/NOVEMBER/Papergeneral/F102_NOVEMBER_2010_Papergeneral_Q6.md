## QUESTION 6

(i) was a standard bookwork question that was surprisingly poorly answered.
(ii) referred to option-pricing which is a section in the notes. Some candidates then
referred to stochastic modelling which is an entirely different section. Although this was not a Financial Economics exam, students were expected to know that an American option involves exercise at any time before a date not between two dates (although the latter is possible using an American forward option).
(iii) was an obvious stochastic modelling question but many candidates didn't indicate
that they would use a stochastic model. Some students had no idea what the formula for return on capital was and instead gave the internal rate of return. Many candidates answered how they would price the guarantee using a cashflow model which was not the question that was asked.
Suggested solution:
(i)

- Profitability. 10

- Marketability.

 - Risk appetite of customers

 - Simplicity

- Competitiveness.

- Financing requirement/Capital.

- Risk characteristics.

- Onerousness/Costs of any guarantees.

 - Probability of guarantee biting

 - Inv options

 - Investment conditions

- Sensitivity of profit.

- Extent of cross-subsidy.

- Administration systems.

- Consistency of other products.

- Treating customers fairly.

- Other regulatory and tax requirements.

- Mortality/withdrawal

- Reinsurance Max 1 mark per bullet Volume and mix were allowed only if an explanation as to how they would impact on pricing was given. No credit given for:

- Customer needs

- Financial requirements

- Level and form of benefits

- Data availability

- Willingness of the distribution channel to sell the product Comments: Ordering and grouping of points was poor with many stating administration to be the chief consideration!

(ii) One needs to find the prices of exchange traded options or use Black-Scholes to price
a replicating portfolio Options on the underlying may not be available so one may need to approximate the underlying investment portfolio using options on equity and bond indices.
Solution 1 If it is assumed that the benefits are paid at the end of the month As benefits can be paid monthly after age 55, the guarantee is equivalent to

- a series of European put options

- on the underlying investment funds

- There will be 181 options in all with strike dates ranging from the 55th birthday to the 70th birthday

- The strike price for each option will be the guaranteed benefit In order to find the cost of the guarantee, conditional probabilities would be required 11

Solution 2 A Forward American Put option could be used.
Forward date is 55th birthday Strike date is 70th birthday On underlying investments Strike price a function of the guarantee (which would invalidate Black-Scholes) No credit given for: Discussions of the North American method.
Discussions on how a model would be used to price the guarantee
(iii)
A stochastic model is required to provide the distribution.
A number of model points will be chosen to represent the expected new business.
The profile of the existing business (modified to allow for any expected future changes ) can be used to obtain the model points.
For each model point and each simulation, benefit, premium and fee cashflows would be simulated using a realisation of a stochastic model of rates of return of returns .
The model should allow for reserving and supervisory capital requirements which will provide an estimate of the capital required . The net present value of the profits will be calculated using a discount rate that reflects the return required by the company . The results for each model point will be grossed up to give the return on capital for the life office . A large number of simulations will be required in order to obtain the distribution.

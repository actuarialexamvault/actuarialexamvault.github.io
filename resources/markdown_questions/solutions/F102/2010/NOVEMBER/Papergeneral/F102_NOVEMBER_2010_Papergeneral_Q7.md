## QUESTION 7

(i) Some students got confused between persistency and withdrawal. Many showed they
don't know that a trend relates to time (as opposed to gender).
(ii) Some evidence of time pressure. Of most concern were the students who identified
that this may be selective withdrawal but who suggested adjustments to the pricing basis that would only exacerbate the situation. Many failed to demonstrate that they understood how to project historic information for pricing purposes.
Suggested solution:
(i) First a period of investigation will be required that is long enough to allow for trends to
be detected - this means at least three periods of data are required. If there are significant changes in the economic environment, these should be taken note of. The data would then need to be divided by: Duration Sales method Frequency and size of premium Original term Age Period {or divided into homogenous groups if no rating factors mentioned} 12

For each duration the number of policies surviving in-force to the end of the year will be divided by the adjusted the number of policies in force at the start of the year adjusted for the number of death claims and maturities to give the persistency rate .
The withdrawal rate is 1- the persistency rate. The persistency rates for men and women with otherwise identical characteristics can then be compared to assess if there is a gender effect . For each cell, the withdrawal rates by period can be compared to assess if there is a trend. The correlation between the different risk factors would need to be determined in order to examine whether correlation effects are evident.

Statistical tests required Checks against industry or reinsurer data should be made to see if they are experiencing the experiencing the same Notes: Quite a few students got the denominator and numerator mixed up but could describe the factors in the persistency rate. A half mark was given for the exposed to risk method of calculating withdrawal rates if the persistency approach was not used.
(ii) The analysis would be done by age , sex , duration , channel , smoker status
and underwriting status . {Province was also given credit but vague references to geographic location or suggestion of cities did not} The values should be projected from the investigation period to reflect the experience on policies sold in the future e.g. an adjustment may be required for HIV prevalence and anticipated changes in underwriting . The rates will be derived from adjusted standard table mortality rates where the adjustment is based on the experience analysis subject to credibilityand possibly allowing for margins. Given the lower persistency among women, the adjustment should be sufficient to discourage selective withdrawal by women.
Notes:
This question was about selective lapsation. If women are leaving, then chances are that competitors could be luring them away with better rates leaving us with lives with heavier mortality so checking against reinsurer or industry experience was considered important and earned credit. However, if female mortality was heavier than expected, the appropriate response is not to raise female rates as this will result in an insurance spiral. 13

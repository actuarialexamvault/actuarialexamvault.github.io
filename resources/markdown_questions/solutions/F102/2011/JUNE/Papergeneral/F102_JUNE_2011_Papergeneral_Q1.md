## QUESTION 1

Mortality:

- If this ruling was applied then, instead of setting separate rates for males and females, we would have to charge a single rate for males & females by age

- We would therefore have to make some assumption about the expected future portfolio mix between males and females

- The historical portfolio gender mix would be a good starting point

- Consider whether this is likely to change, as you would be charging females significantly more than previously and the new gender mix might therefore be different

- There may be a tendency for the mix by gender to stabilize across companies as there will no longer be gender-based selection based on pricing

- The assumption would also change as the result of it having to take account of possible changes in things such as target market Expenses (incl. commission):

- Would not, in general, be affected by the ruling

- However, there may be a once-off cost associated with communicating the change to policyholders and updating product literature. Inflation:

- Would not be affected by the ruling Lapses:

- The premium rates for males after the introduction of the ruling could fall significantly, which may cause a substantial lapse & re-entry problem (from current policies to the new ones)

- Not likely to be the case for females though, as they may not get cover as cheaply again

- Any such lapses are likely to be selective, increasing mortality rates on the current portfolio

- For new policies sold after the introduction of the ruling a weighted average of historic male & female lapse rate assumptions may be used (if available) Investment return:

- Would not be affected by the ruling, but this is not a key assumption as the reserves held for term assurances are small Profit margin:

Several candidates wasted time discussing assumptions that were not the main assumptions as instructed.
Many candidates misunderstood/misstated the effect of selective lapses, saying that females will lapse because of higher rates whereas in fact it is the males who will get cheaper rates and therefore lapse and re-enter. Many candidates claimed (without substantiation) that females have higher lapses and that this change would drive it up even further.
There were also many candidates who suggested that females would no longer buy life insurance because of the price increase. This is extremely unlikely though because the rate change is not likely to be hugely significant and, furthermore, if you need life insurance you will simply have to pay the higher premium as there is no alternative.

## QUESTION 2

i. Importance of financial underwriting:

- The main purpose of financial underwriting is to make sure that the policyholder is not over-insured. Over-insurance poses a moral hazard. For death benefits, in the extreme case, an individual may commit suicide to save his / her business, or to provide funds for his / her family. Even if there is a suicide exclusion clause it is often very difficult to prove suicide.

- The second issue is affordability. If the policyholder has a higher sum insured than they really need, there is more of a chance that they will not be able to afford the premiums at some time in the future. If this is the case the lapse rates will be higher than anticipated and you will be less likely to recoup your up-front expenses, which will be higher for large sums insured.

- The third major issue, linked to issue two, is that if people are generally over-insured it may lead to selective lapsation. If people have too much cover, many of them will lapse, or reduce their cover, if they don't need it or can't afford it. However, anyone who becomes sick after taking out the policy will keep the policy, leading to worse experience in the long run.

ii. Issues with doing financial underwriting:

- Sometimes financial underwriting is easy to do, for example if someone is formally employed and can provide you with a salary slip.

- However, many people who take out insurance are self employed and getting proof of income is not straightforward.

- Such underwriting may be unpopular amongst potential customers and there may be resistance to providing the information required.

- Anything which may slow the time taken to accept a proposal will be unpopular with the distribution channel.

- Companies asking for proof of income can be at a competitive disadvantage, in particular in countries where this is not common practice (e.g. South Africa).

- For business insurance the underwriter needs to place a value on the business. This is not a trivial exercise and requires financial skills in terms of interpreting income statements and balance sheets.

- Often financial statements are out of date or not audited.

- Carrying out financial underwriting can be an expensive exercise. iii, Reinsurer could assist you by:

- Comparing your practices to:

- the rest of the market.

- international best practice.

- Helping you analyse your book of business relative to the market to see if you are getting:

- more large sums insured than the rest of the market.

- comparable levels of profitability

- Putting appropriate reinsurance structures in place, e.g. surplus reinsurance, which will remove the volatility of your results.

- Providing assistance in establishing appropriate practices, e.g. through the provision of:

- underwriting manuals

- training to your underwriters. Overall the question was not answered that well. Several candidates gave answers about general underwriting which were not specific to financial underwriting, and thus did not get credit. Credit was also not given for generic points such as "regulation".

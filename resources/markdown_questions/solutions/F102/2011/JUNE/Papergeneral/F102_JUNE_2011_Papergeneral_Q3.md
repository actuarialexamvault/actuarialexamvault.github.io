## QUESTION 3

i. Possible reasons:

- Anti-selection, driven by the limited underwriting at proposal stage. Sickly people are taking out the policy and are passing away shortly thereafter.

- Incorrect pricing basis for mortality. The mortality basis used in pricing is lighter than the population into which the policies are sold.

ii. Reasons:

- To understand the reasons for the experience in order to take corrective action, e.g. change the pricing basis for future sales

- To ascertain the potential size of current and future losses

- To assist with analysis of profit/surplus

- To assist in reserving appropriately

- To provide management information on the experience (e.g. as requested by the CEO)

- To enable the identification and analysis of trends in experience

iii. Information required:

- Full policy information for each claim, e.g. sum assured, age of policyholder, etc. to enable analysis down to this level.

- The causes of death of the policyholders, particularly the split between natural and accidental deaths.

- The medical history of the policyholders in question. This will be compared to their answers on the proposal form to check if they answered honestly.

- The repudiation rate. It is possible that the actual number of approved claims is roughly consistent with the pricing basis.

- The geographical areas in which deaths occurred in order to assess if they are concentrated in a specific area.

- The sales channel / intermediaries attached to the policies to determine if the deaths relate to policies sold by a specific channel / intermediary(ies).

iv. Recommendations & considerations:
a. Repudiate claims where dishonesty is detected.

- Consider the possible bad publicity if the market views this as the company reneging on its promises to pay claims. b. Change the benefit structure, by for example:

- Using an initial waiting period, or only returning premiums on death due to natural causes in the first year say.

- Reducing the cover level for natural deaths in the first six months to say 25%.

- Consider that the policy will not be attractive, impacting sales (marketability).

c. Introduce more rigorous initial and/or claims underwriting.

- Consider the additional costs and that this will make the policy less attractive, possibly impacting sales.

d. Stop selling the product

Most marks on this question were lost in part (iii), where the vast majority of candidates explained the process rather than giving the "information required" to carry out an investigation.
In part (iv) it was surprising how many candidates mentioned reinsurance despite the question clearly stating "other than through the use of reinsurance".
Both of the problems mentioned above can be attributed to candidates not reading the questions carefully enough.

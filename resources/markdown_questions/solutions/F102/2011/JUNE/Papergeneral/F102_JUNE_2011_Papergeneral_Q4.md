## QUESTION 4

i. A financial economic approach would seek to set future unknown parameter values so as to
be consistent with market values where they exist.
Assumed parameter values for future investment returns would be based on a risk-free rate of return, irrespective of the type of asset held.
This compares with the traditional actuarial approach of assuming a risk-free rate of return on government bonds plus a margin for equities.
The financial economic approach would argue that in the long term the equity margin should also be combined with an increased risk of not achieving the increased yield, the net result being the risk-free rate of return.
ii. The liability value is the sum of the unit fund and the non-unit fund.
The liability relating to the unit fund is: unit price × number of units for all policyholders.
The valuation of the non-unit fund requires a projection of all non-unit fund expected cashflows in each future year from the portfolio, namely expenses, charges, guarantee benefit outgo and investment returns on these cashflows.
A projection of the unit fund is required for calculating asset-related charges and expenses and the cost of the minimum guaranteed benefits. used for projection of benefits and for discounting the cashflows will be based on current risk-free interest rates.
Term-dependant interest rates will be required for projections and discounting cashflows in each year, which can be obtained from an appropriate yield curve (e.g. government-backed zero-coupon yield curve).
If the cashflows were certain and guaranteed amounts, the market value of the portfolio of zero-coupon bonds replicating the liability cashflows (i.e. replicating portfolio) would represent the required market-consistent valuation.

However the liability cashflows are subject to uncertainty.
In this instance there is uncertainty due to decrement experience (lapses, surrenders, mortality), expenses and expense inflation, and the cost of providing the minimum guaranteed benefits.
The liability created by the investment guarantee could be evaluated using option-pricing techniques or stochastic simulation.

- Option prices: the maturity guarantee corresponds to a European style put option written by the insurer with an exercise price corresponding to the maturity guarantee. The market-consistent valuation of the guarantee is assessed by determining the current market price of corresponding put options.

In part (i), despite it being bookwork, a number of candidates were not familiar with the basic differences between financial economic and traditional actuarial approaches.
In part (ii) common problems were:

- Very few candidates made the obvious comment that the total reserve is the sum of the unit and non-unit reserves;

- Almost no-one specified the simple formula for unit reserve = bid unit price x No. Of units. A number of candidates set the unit reserve equal to the underlying asset value. While it should equal the value of assets, it might not be (e.g. due to errors in unit pricing) in which case the liability to the company is not equal to the value of assets.

- Some candidates assumed there is only a unit reserve and a reserve for the guarantee, and some candidates only considered the reserve for the guarantee.

- A number of candidates misread the question and made points around guaranteed death and surrender benefits (and not maturity benefits).

- Many candidates took the approach of finding the replicating portfolio, and treated this as an investments question, assuming it is a simple matter to find such a portfolio. Many candidates ignored the uncertainty in cashflows created by decrements and expenses.

- Many candidates took the approach of valuing the maturity guarantee liability as the value of a zero-coupon bond portfolio that will replicate this liability, without any deduction from unit reserves. This is over-prudent, as it requires the insurer to hold this reserve in addition to the unit reserve (and non-unit reserve for expenses etc.), and assumes that 100% of this guarantee reserve will be required 100% of the time in addition to the unit reserve.

- Despite being bookwork, few candidates were able to discuss correctly the methods for valuing guarantees (European put options and stochastic approach).

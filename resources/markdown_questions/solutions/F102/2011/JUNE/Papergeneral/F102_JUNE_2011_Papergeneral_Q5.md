## QUESTION 5

i. Possible reasons for differences might include:

- Different model structures, including:

- Distributions assumed for asset class returns (incl. skewness and kurtosis);

- Different assumed long-term relationships between variables;

- Different variables assumed to be mean-reverting e.g. dividend yield (Wilkie) or real short term interest rate (Barrie-Hibbert);

- Different 'base variables' that are generated randomly and used to determine other projected or 'derived variables' (e.g. using projected dividends or inflation to derive share prices);

- Frequency of projected returns and cashflows e.g. monthly vs annual;

- Different allowance for changes over time in projected asset volatility or correlations between returns.

- Different input assumptions used due to:

- different model structure requiring different inputs;

- calibrated to market variables on different days;

- Other factors, including:

- Results not comparable e.g. if based on different number of runs, projection period, or liability/model point data;

- Results might be misinterpreted (e.g. if the output is in a complex unfriendly format).

ii. Factors to consider in deciding the choice of model:

- How well do the internal and commercial models measure up against one another in terms of being "good" models fit-for-purpose? i.e.

- Model output should be representative and realistic/plausible: the model should mimic the behaviour of assets by capturing their most important characteristics;

- Output needs to be clearly displayed, understandable and easily communicable

- Economic interpretation: the behaviour of the assets should be consistent with generally accepted economic principles e.g. no-arbitrage principles;

- Model should be flexible enough to easily run alternative parameters or change assumptions such as asset return distributions and for subsequent refinement;

- Joint behaviour of model variables should be realistic (e.g. inflation and interest rates);

- Simplicity: model should avoid being unnecessarily complex to enable scenarios to be generated quickly and errors to be identified and corrected easily;

- Should be able to easily integrate with existing valuation and other software;

- Model should be fully documented and auditable;

- Practical Issues:

- Cost of commercial model (initial and ongoing) compared to continuing with inhouse model;

- Level of support available for implementation, operational use and future development of commercial model compared to level of in-house expertise;

- Level of acceptance of the commercial model by regulators and other insurers.

"accuracy" can be assessed (or thinking whether it is even possible to assess "accuracy"). Some candidates suggested using the model that gives the lowest cost of guarantees!
Very few candidates thought of the key issue of maintaining consistency of results with previously used models.

## QUESTION 6

i. Uses for Asset Shares include:

- Bonus Declarations

- Comparing the accrued liability to asset share, gives an indication of the surplus available for distribution

- Assists in deciding on the size of terminal bonuses (UK style) and sustainability of reversionary bonuses

- Monitor Fairness

- The asset share relative to the benefit due (particularly where there is a discretionary component), could be used to monitor fairness across tranches of business & policies

- Surrender values

- On average the benefit on surrender (or liability after a policy alteration), should not exceed the accrued asset share

- Market Value Adjustment Factor

- The asset share compared to the smoothed benefit (under a unitized with profit contract), gives an indication of any market value adjustment factor that may be required

- Policy alterations

- On average the value of the benefit after alteration should not exceed the accrued asset share

- Profit Distribution

- Gives an indication of surplus arising, which can then be shared between policyholders and shareholders (often on a prescribed basis like 90:10)

- Planning

- Projection of solvency position of fund / company over time

- Expected profitability of a book of business OR monitoring the effect of actual experience being different to the expected experience on a book of business

ii. Practical problems:

- Assets on WP and NP (or different WP groups) are likely to be combined. A decision is therefore necessary on how to allocate the actual investment returns to areas of business (e.g. shareholders, term assurance and WP) and between tranches of business

- This may also be dependent on the appropriate asset mix for each of the tranches of business

- The actual investment return cannot always be directly observed (e.g. on less marketable assets like property). Some approximate method will be required to determine the investment return on these assets e.g. the use of indices

- Available indices may not accurately reflect the actual underlying assets held

- The return allocated to the asset share may be smoothed over time. The extent of smoothing is subjective

- Investment returns should be net of tax

- Need to allow for the accrual of tax on unrealized gains

- There may be relatively complicated expense relief calculation that can only be approximated in advance e.g. different tax rates on capital gains and interest/rental, expense relief also dependent on allocation of expenses

- The actual investment return needs to be reduced by investment expenses. Some approximations may be required

- The data quality and detail necessary for calculation may not be available

- "Accurate" calculations may only be done periodically. Some approximation is required for the intermediate terms

- Some policies may provide working capital and an allowance for the cost of capital needs to be made which may be difficult to determine Part (i) was a straightforward bookwork question and most candidates performed well. Candidates that did not score well on this question generally just "listed" uses where the question required a brief description of the use. Some candidates wasted time giving more than the four uses asked for (only the first four listed gained credit if more than four were given). Answers to part (ii) were generally poor, with most candidates only able to describe a limited range of practical problems.

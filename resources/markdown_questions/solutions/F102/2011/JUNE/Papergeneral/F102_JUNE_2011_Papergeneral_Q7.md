## QUESTION 7

Principles:

- PRE

- As determined by past practice, policy documentation and past experience

- Do not create unrealistic policyholder expectations

- Equity

- Between different tranches of business

- You do not unnecessarily want to defer surplus distribution, because shareholder profit transfer is often dependent on bonus declarations (e.g. 90:10 rule)

- Financial soundness of company and "scheme" / level of free assets

- Ensure bonus rates are sustainable, given long term assumptions

- Relatively higher RB increases guarantees and affects the statutory solvency position

- Ensure company has the ability to deal with potential adverse experience in the future

- Availability of shareholder capital

- To absorb adverse experience

- For working capital (with profit fund could be a source of working capital)

- Consistent with the company's investment strategy

- Consistent with the company's (stated) bonus philosophy

- Extent of smoothing

- Comply with the description in the policy documentation and the scheme's with profit guide

- Rates should be competitive compared to competitor rates (subject to affordability).

- If it is not competitive it could

- Negatively affect new business volumes

- Increase surrenders

- Bonus rates should be sustainable in the short term to prevent frequent changes to the interim bonus rates

- Consistent with any professional guidance notes / regulation

- Tax

- The bonus declaration may have implications for any tax liability

- Business Objectives / Strategy

- The bonus declaration should support any business strategy (e.g. new business acquisition), subject to principles outlined above The majority of candidates were able to outline most of the principles and thus most scored well. Some candidates described the alternative methods of distribution (e.g. simple reversionary bonus versus compound reversionary bonus) in some detail, where the question required an outline of the main principles for surplus distributions. Such answers did not score well.

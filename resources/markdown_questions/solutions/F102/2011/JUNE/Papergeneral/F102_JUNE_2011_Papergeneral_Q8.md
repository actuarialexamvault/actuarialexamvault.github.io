## QUESTION 8

i. Principles for surrenders:

- Feasibility:

- Consider any legislative requirements/restrictions and market practice in the country.

- Affordability:

- As losses are inevitable at early durations (when asset shares may even be negative) the company may compensate by having surrender values below asset shares at later durations.

- The company should treat withdrawing and continuing policyholders equitably:

- Thus on surrender of a non-profit contract the office may try to recoup a similar amount of profit as it would had the contract not been surrendered

- This is not always possible (or desirable as it can be argued that the office has no entitlement to future profit on premiums not yet paid)

- For practical reasons the company may end up using a blend between surrender values being based on: § asset shares initially (when > 0), moving towards § a prospective method (with realistic assumptions) later on, where full expected profit is then retained by the company

- The values should be consistent with policyholder's reasonable expectations (PRE). This could include:

- consistency with quotations at outset

- reasonableness of early surrender values relative to premiums paid (or premiums plus some interest)

- running smoothly into maturity values (which may on occasion involve paying more than asset share - which should only be done where absolutely necessary owing to the principle of affordability)

- having regard to competition and auction values (if any)

- Practical Issues:

- the method should be well-documented

- it should be simple to apply and easy to explain

- the scale should not change too frequently owing to the administrative work involved

- anti-selection should be avoided, e.g. selective withdrawals or financial antiselection, and surrender values should take account of financial conditions

- surrender values, in conjunction with new business premiums, should not encourage lapse and re-entry

- surrender values should be stable, i.e. small differences in policies should produce small differences in surrender values

- whether any "blending" is required between an old and a new surrender value scale

- surrender values should be consistent with any other alterations offered

ii. Possible alterations to the endowment assurance:

- Reduce the sum assured

iii. Considerations that apply to both alterations:

- The alteration should be supported by the Asset Share, on average

- Given that the alterations happens so early in the contract term, the asset share is likely to be negative and the company should consider how to recoup this loss (if possible)

- With a reduction in the premium so early on in the product term, commission clawback is likely and could be used to decrease the strain on alteration

- A reasonable profit should be allowed to emerge

- At the date of conversion, and

- Over the future lifetime of the policy, given the risks and PRE

- The alterations should be consistent with PRE and be fair

- Altered policy should be consistent (in terms of sum assured & term) with new business sold at the revised level of premium

- Allow appropriately for expenses on alterations

- Impact of the alteration basis for these alterations on the surrender benefit

- The SV before the alterations and the SV benefit immediately after the alterations should be similar to minimize the lapse and re-entry risk.

- Practical issues

- The method should be stable over time

- The method should not be too difficult to apply or explain to the policyholder

- The alteration basis should be well documented

- Avoid "strange" results, e.g. the 25% reduction in premium producing a vastly disproportionate decrease in sum assured (or increase in term) Differences:

- Reduction in sum assured

- Ensure consistency with paid-up values (the limiting case of a reduction in sum assured as a result of a reduction in premium)

- The basis may need to allow for the cost of death cover already provided

- With a reduction in the death benefit, arguably less profit should be extracted (in absolute terms), from the altered policy because the risk is reduced

- Increase in policy term

- Additional underwriting may be required

- Where commission is term related there may be additional commission due

Part (iii) was very poorly answered on the whole. Candidates who scored well on this question highlighted a range of issues. A common mistake made by candidates was to merely list a range of points, instead of comparing and contrasting how the issues raised would affect the two alterations.

## QUESTION 9

i. Needs met:

- Can provide for liabilities due on death, e.g. funeral cover, inheritance tax, etc.

- Can pass on wealth from parents to children in a tax-efficient way

- Can provide a savings element through the unit fund

- The surrender value can provide emergency funding prior to death if required

ii. a. Investment Performance:

- Not a significant direct risk if monies to be allocated to units are invested immediately in the unit fund

- There is an indirect impact on profitability as poor returns will lead to lower management charges than anticipated

- As the charges in this design are unit related, the risk could be significant (as the charges may be vital for profitability).

- Poor investment performance will lead to unhappy policyholders and bad publicity and a competitive disadvantage, which reduce sales and increased withdrawals.

- While the variable management charge can reduce the risk associated with low charges when units under-perform, increasing the rate of management charges would increase policyholder dissatisfaction. b. Expenses:

- The risk is that the expenses are not covered by the management charge

- The level of expenses will be uncertain because the office is entering a new market with a product new to that market, e.g. admin., development & marketing costs

- The costs of implementing premium reviews may not be known up front.

- Changes in the mix of business from that anticipated is also a problem as there are likely to be cross-subsidies involved in expense recoupment (between policies with large & small unit funds)

- Lower than expected new business volumes is also a risk as fixed expenses may not be adequately recouped

- More withdrawals than expected may result In overhead expenses not being covered, although the surrender penalty may reduce this risk.

- Higher than anticipated inflation may be a big concern as the terms of cover may be fairly long

- Charges are fund-related and so might be expected to beat inflation

- Reviewable charges can in theory protect the company. However, the company may not be able to review charges owing to factors such as policyholder reasonable expectations and competitive pressure.

c. Mortality:

- the risk is that the office underestimates mortality (when the unit fund is below the guaranteed death benefit)

- the office has no experience in this market and so needs to source appropriate assumptions elsewhere, e.g. from a reinsurer

- the extent of the risk will depend on how applicable the data used are

- adequate allowance for the uncertain mortality should be allowed for in pricing, although reviewable charges should alleviate some of the pressure in this respect

- the reviewable charges and premiums may encourage the office to make unrealistically low estimates of future mortality in pricing and reserving bases

- even though adverse mortality experience can in theory be dealt with by reviewing charges and premiums it is not certain that the market will accept significant increases at that time

- anti-selection will be a problem since the initial premium for a given level of cover should be lower than that of competitors offering conventional whole life products (owing to reviewable charges and premiums only being guaranteed for 10 years)

- selective withdrawals are also a risk, in particular at the time of premium review

- if mortality experience is favourable, the office may come under pressure to reduce mortality charges (and premiums at review)

iii. Risks faced by policyholders:

- Benefits not received

- through insolvency of insurer

- there could be a challenge by the insurer based on incorrect information supplied by policyholder at outset, e.g. if there is a pre-existing condition exclusion

- Benefits less valuable than expected

- performance of the assets underlying the units worse than anticipated (even negative), resulting in lower benefit payments

- currency risk as units are not denominated in local currency

- benefits eroded due to regular charges increasing at a rate greater than expected

- benefits on surrender being lower than anticipated owing to surrender penalty

- benefits not properly explained (e.g. assumed they will keep pace with inflation)

- unanticipated increases in costs which the policy was intended to cover

- not received when expected

- taxation changes impacting on amounts received

- Higher cost than expected

- premium may become unaffordable after the premium review

iv. Recouping initial expenses:

- Initial expenses will have to be recouped through the management charge as this is the only charge (other than the benefit charge) on the contract.

- The management charge will thus need to be higher than required to merely recoup renewal expenses, and could either be increased on all units issued or only on "Capital units" issued during an initial period (less popular nowadays).

- In either case a unit-related surrender penalty will be required to recoup outstanding initial expenses on early surrenders

- Actuarial funding can then be employed to reduce new business strain, viz:

- initially purchase fewer units than notionally allocated

- purchase the "missing" units over time from the future unit-related profits (associated with the extra management charges on the units)

- a lower unit reserve is permissible because the full unit fund is only required on death, which thus reduces new business strain

- the larger initial cash flow produced provides a better timing match for initial expenses, and reduces the company's exposure to the investment risk Overall the question was not answered well. In part (i) several candidates only looked at the benefits of the policy relative to conventional non-profit business, instead of giving the general needs met. In part (ii) several answers were too generic, for example listing "model risk, parameter risk and random fluctuations risk". In part (a) some answers would have been better suited to the risks posed by a conventional policy. Many candidates also spent a lot of time describing how the guaranteed minimum death benefit poses an investment risk, with several candidates treating it like a maturity value guarantee. This guarantee only presents a risk in terms of the rate of benefit charge not being appropriate (i.e. mortality risk). In part (b) it should be noted that high expenses, per se, are not a problem (as these can be allowed for if known in advance) - it is expenses greater than expected which pose a problem. In part (iii) the question asked candidates to "outline briefly". It is thus not sufficient to simply list generic factors such as poor equity investment performance, high charges, etc., without indicating why these are risks for the policyholder. Candidates did not always differentiate between premium increases and increases in charges. In part (iv) most candidates did identify actuarial funding as the way to reduce new business strain, but failed to give an adequate description of the method.

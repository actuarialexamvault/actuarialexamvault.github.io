## QUESTION 1

i.Principles of investment that apply to a life insurance company

- Select investments appropriate to the nature, term, and currency of the liabilities.

- Select investments to maximise the overall return on the assets (income and capital)

- Can depart from the first principle in order to improve the return, depending on resources

- The higher the basic sum assured for a given premium, the greater the proportion of fixed interest type investments that should be held.

- Methods that defer distribution of surplus need a lower proportion of fixed interest investments. But returns on equities are expected to be volatile and policyholders will expect the bonus rates to be smoother than returns earned on equities. The impact of this smoothing will reduce the free assets when equity returns are low and increase them when equity returns are high The company therefore needs sufficient free assets to smooth the bonus rates. If there is a low level of free assets, this will limit the extent to which the company can invest in equities unless shareholders are willing to inject significant capital into the company. The insurer can mismatch if there are sufficient free assets that are not used to support mismatching on other products. But if they depart from a matched strategy, there is no guarantee on the returns earned on equities and this strategy may open the insurer up to the risk of insolvency. Investing in equities is likely to lead to more stringent reserving and solvency requirements (resilience reserves). Investment in equities must be consistent with regulatory requirements. (Regulatory rules may limit the types of amounts of assets of certain types that can be held.). Part (i) was straight forward bookwork, nevertheless a large number of students did not get full marks for this part. Part (ii) required candidates to apply investment matching principles to the two products and was reasonable well answered. Candidates who scored well were able to discuss the investment strategy in relation to discretionary benefits. Part (iii) was poorly answered. Many candidates did not relate their discussion to the two products. As a result they failed to discuss equity investment in relation to smoothing of bonuses for the with profit product.

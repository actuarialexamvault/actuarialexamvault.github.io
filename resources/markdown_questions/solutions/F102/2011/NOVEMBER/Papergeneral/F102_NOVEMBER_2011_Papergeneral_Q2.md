## QUESTION 2

i. Factors to be considered when setting withdrawal assumptions
Consider withdrawal basis used in the previous valuation.
Base on analysis of company's recent experience making allowance for special factors such as an adverse economic situation.
Split data by duration, product and type of withdrawal Need to make adjustments for expected future experience Factors relating to the closure of the insurer

- If another life insurance company purchased the sales force then the clients may be actively targeted and encouraged to transfer.

- Policyholders may have a lack of confidence in the company now that it has closed, which may cause surrenders to increase.

- There may be significantly higher withdrawals immediately following the closure that have not yet come through in the data .

- However, if there are surplus assets (or .estate.) in the fund then the prospect of sharing in their distribution may have a positive effect on persistency. General market factors that may affect withdrawals

- Consider how actions of competitors (eg through the introduction of new products that may be more appealing to policyholders)

ii. Additional risks to insurer as a result of closing to new business
Higher withdrawal rates may introduce immediate liquidity risk due to non-payment of premiums and surrender benefits.
The level of risk depends on the mix of recurring/single premium business and the size of any surrender benefits.
If withdrawals are selective, this may result in mortality experience being worse than expected. As volumes decline as the book runs off (exacerbated by the withdrawals), overheads will be spread over fewer policies.
Mortality experience will also become more volatile.
There may be extraordinary costs associated with the closure that may be higher than anticipated.
As the assets decrease, diversification may become more problematic, resulting in higher investment risk.
The closure itself may damage the reputation of the company .

- This would be exacerbated if there are retrenchments as a result of the closure.

- If low staff morale or shrinking service teams result in poor client service.

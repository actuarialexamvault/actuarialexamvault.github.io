## QUESTION 3

i The purpose of underwriting is:

- To protect the integrity of the risk pool against anti-selection

- To create homogeneous risk pools that are charged premium commensurate with each pool's risk

iii

- Insurer's own experience of similar product

- Most appropriate as reflects own target market

- Reinsurers data (reinsurer will have wider data base and likely to be more relevant type of business and lives covered might be important since this is a small insurer that is not likely to have sufficient information)

- Industry (insured lives) mortality statistics, possibly produced by the actuarial profession

The insurer needs cat cover given the region that this insurer is operating in (dense population with seismic risk) there is a significant risk of accumulation of claims.
Under catastrophe cover is tail risk (extreme events) are ceded to the reinsurer.
Cat cover lowers the probability of ruin and avoids deterioration in the solvency position, which is important in this case where the insurer is concerned about the solvency position.
Considerations Free assets and importance of stability of the solvency levels - will influence the desired level of risk. Need to consider the terms and conditions available on different types and retention levels. Other benefits e.g. reinsurance commission, profit sharing, technical assistance. Options other than reinsurance e.g. consider the cost of financing a reserve for mortality fluctuations vs the cost of obtaining reinsurance.

Counterparty risk: even if the insurer cedes most of the risk to the reinsurer, insurer still liable for the claims if the insurer defaults, need to consider the risk of default of the insurer.
Reinsurance programmes for other business. i.e. reinsurance programme for this book of business within the overall reinsurance programme of the insurer and the effect of overall solvency of insurer.
Parts i - iii were very easy bookwork and almost all students scored very well. Part iv was an application and most students struggled. Students wrote about reinsurance in general rather than the evaluation of the reinsurance programme. Many students also suggested a reinsurance programme rather than discussion the evaluation of one. These answers did not address the question and no marks were given.

## QUESTION 4

i)

- The with-profit contract participates in the profits/losses of a defined book of business

- A regular bonus is usually added annually which will be calculated in relation to premiums paid to date plus previously declared bonus

- A terminal bonus might also be added when a policy becomes a claim (e.g. on death, maturity or surrender)

- Once-off sources of profit could be distributed as once-off immediate bonuses as may be done with conventional with-profit contracts

- It looks and operates like a unit-linked contract, but the key difference is how the unit prices and hence benefits are determined

- There is a minimum guaranteed increase/addition (equal to 0% p.a. on net premiums) because bonuses already declared cannot normally be removed

- Other guarantees is at the company's discretion

- On surrender, the company will apply a surrender penalty

- May retain the right to apply a market value adjustment (MVA)

- The size of the MVA is at the discretion of the company, bearing in mind policyholder expectation while the surrender penalty is usually specified in the policy

- Death benefits could vary according to the type of policy, for example a guaranteed sum assured, return of premiums, return of fund

- It is not usual for an MVA to be applied to death benefits

- There is flexibility in terms of premium payments, which may be single lump sum, recurring single premiums or regular monthly or annual premiums

- Charging structures could be any combination of charges

 - policy fees (from premium or fund)

 - allocation rates

 - bid/offer spreads

 - annual management charges

 - risk benefit charge

 - Actuarial funding

 - Front-end load

 - Capital and accumulation units

- Or alternatively the charges could be taken implicitly through the bonus rate, with no explicit charges used. This is a bookwork question. Students performed surprisingly poorly in this question. Overall there was a lack of understanding between the differences between accumulating with profits and conventional with profits. Where students did differentiate this correctly, insufficient detail was provided to score well. ii)

- The minimum guarantee that policyholders are likely to appreciate is 0% per annum i.e. a return of premiums (after charges)

- However, guarantees offered by competition should also be considered, which may be higher e.g. 2-3% p.a.

- Alternatively, policyholders may want a return that would at least cover the charges on the product

- Capital requirements should also be considered as statutory reserves will be influenced by the guaranteed rate

- The guarantee that can be offered is dependent on the underlying investments backing the units

- A more conservative strategy may reduce risk but is inconsistent with policyholder expectations but may reduce the cost of the guarantee

- As a pure equity strategy may increase the cost so much that it is unaffordable

- The impact of either an increased cost and/or the change in the different investments available should be weighed up against the marketability of the guarantee.

- If a market value adjustment (MVA) cannot be applied on surrender, it will make any guarantee more onerous. Even if the MVA can be applied contractually, there may be marketing reasons not to apply it

- Tax on investment return should also be taken into account, because it reduces the investment return

- A higher guarantee would reduce profitability when investment returns are poor but would increase profits otherwise. Would need to set the guarantee such that the probability of profit on the product is sufficiently high.

- The level of the guarantee in comparison to other products offered by the company needs to be compared to avoid the possibility of lapse and re-entry Students appeared to perform better in this question that 4 i). Overall the performance was still poor as many students did not appear to focus on the question asked. The question specifically asked about setting of the guaranteed element of the regular bonus rate.

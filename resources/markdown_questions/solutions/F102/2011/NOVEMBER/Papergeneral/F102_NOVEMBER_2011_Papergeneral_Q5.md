## QUESTION 5

i The following points scored credit Surrender penalties need to be set considering what the initial expenses are and what the mechanisms are for recouping them.
Penalties should limit losses or capitalise on some forgone profit however at early durations the asset shares may be negative, and a loss may be unavoidable.
E.g. if using capital and accumulation units, would want a unit related penalty.
The insurer will want to profit test the surrender penalty assumption, however they will need to exercise caution in that RP and SP withdrawal experience will be different so cannot rely on own data It may be a statutory reserve requirement that reserves cannot be less than the surrender value, hence the penality will impact on capital requirements which will need to be taken account of in profit testing The surrender penalty will constrain actuarial funding factors Penalties must be in line with regulation.
Penalty should run to zero (or a low amount) near to maturity (note that this is not the same as saying the surrender value should be in line with the projected maturity amount) PRE, as determined by marketing material, disclosures etc must be met.
Penalties should not be significantly worse than that offered by competitors.
Surrender penalties must not be subject to frequent change for reasons that would be unclear to the policyholder .
Penalties should be consistent with surrender values on similar conventional business.
Penalties should be easy to document and explain Terms should not encourage lapsation which will impact on fixed expense recovery Penalties should cover the cost of withdrawal.

ii The model projects expected cash and profit flows for a single policy These results would then need to be grossed up based on the projected business mix. The model would need to be able to take different charging structures into account .The unit fund(s) and non-unit fund would need to be projected. The model would need to make an allowance for the surrender benefit and possible zeroisation of negative non-unit fund cashflows after year 1 as well as any actuarial funding. The net projected cashflows would then be discounted at a risk discount rate reflecting the required return on capital and the risk attaching to the cashflows. The profit may be measured as a net present value, profit margin, internal rate of return or discounted payback. The model may be stochastic or deterministic. iii One product may be more profitable than the other or offer more stable profits for different economic scenarios or for different business mixes. One may involve crosssubsidies that may appear unfair.
The first design is less capital intensive. The second design can be made less capital intensive by using actuarial funding(subject to regulation and the extent to which actuarial The front end load may make meeting early death guarantees more onerous funding can be used given that a surrender benefit is offered.
The second design may be more administratively difficult to manage than the first but consider any other unit-linked products the company offers. In general, whichever design appears more consistent to consumers and is more consistent administratively would be preferred.
Front end load is unappealing to investors, particularly for policies of short duration. But the 2 unit funds are confusing. Sales channels should be considered: front end load highlights commission and hence won't appeal to brokers.
Consider competitors - if we price similarly to them, structure will appear more acceptable But comparability will increase competition on pricing. Any regulations on pricing should be considered. Pricing must not appear to be unfair or overly penal in first 2 years.

Capital units can be viewed as deceptive. They can be equally as penal for surrenders as a front end load if surrender penalties are sufficiently high (but this may be difficult in practice).
The front end load is a poor match for ongoing expenses and hence sensitivity to expense inflation should be tested.
Capital units do not provide a good match for initial expenses by nature (unit vs monetary) and term. Poor investment returns may result in under-recoupment of expenses in structure b but this should nevertheless provide a good match for ongoing expenses.
This question was disappointingly handled with few students showing any real understanding of unit linked products. Part i required students to consider setting surrender penalties which are usually entirely transparent in a unit-linked product. Part ii required a simple overview of the model not a detailed discussion on the model points or how the model would be parameterised. Part iii required application of the generic list in the core reading to the structures described.

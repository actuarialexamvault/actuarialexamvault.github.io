## QUESTION 6

Brokers are incentivized to sell risk as opposed to savings policies Brokers will start to favour risk business generally which will have a positive impact on risk business volumes The change reduces the initial cashflow for brokers resulting in a poor match for their expenses.
Thus some brokers may leave the market entirely...
Resulting in lower new business volumes for both risk and savings Impact on risk insurer Risk products still incur high New Business Strain due to the upfront commission And hence new business strain should increase due to higher volumes This will result in a need for more capital... ... and will also result in a decrease in the solvency strength at the next valuation However, if brokers are trying to restore their revenue levels, they may oversell risk products resulting in poor persistency And misspelling resulting in reputational risk Impact on savings insurer New business strain will decrease because of regular commission...

The new commission structure results in the products being less capital intensive This question was poorly answered by many students. Very few (if any) referred to the fact that some brokers might leave the market due to expenses not being matched. Many did not think that risk insurer will be influenced because commission structure didn't change on risk side.

## QUESTION 7

i

- The reserves should cover all liabilities arising from all contracts

- Reserves should be calculated prudently, allowing for all relevant liabilities

- Including: guaranteed benefits, guaranteed surrender values, guaranteed bonuses, options available to policyholder, future bonuses of all kinds, taking into account PRE, expenses (incl commission)

- Reserves should take credit for future premiums if these are contractually due to be paid

- Valuation should be prudent, not best estimate, and so the basis should contain margins

- Valuation of liabilities should be consistent with assets (or should take account of the nature, term and method of valuation of the corresponding assets)

- Appropriate approximations and generalisations may be allowed

- Interest rate used for calculating reserves should be chosen prudently, taking into account the currencies, yields and reinvestment yields on the assets

- Elements of the statistical basis, that is the demographic, withdrawal assumptions and expense assumptions, should be chosen prudently, having regard to type of insurance, country where insured people live, but expenses can be on an ongoing business basis

- Where no explicit allowance is made for future bonuses, they must be allowed for implicitly by a suitable adjustment to the valuation interest rate

- If valuation method itself defines the amount of expenses assumed (eg net premium method), then the amount implied must be no less than a prudent estimate of the relevant expenses

- Method of calculation of reserves from year to year should be such as to recognise profit in an appropriate way over the duration of each policy

- Valuation calculations conducted over time should not suffer discontinuities arising from arbitrary changes to the basis

- Valuation methods and bases should be disclosed

ii Prudence The net premium is suitably prudent: Guaranteed benefits (initial sum assured plus bonuses to date) are valued directly (must specify what constitutes guaranteed benefits) But the net premium method would not allow for cost of options and so an additional reserve would be needed Future premiums are valued Future bonuses Allowance is made through a reduction to the valuation rate of interest The difference between the office and net premium may include a margin for future bonuses Terminal bonus is not reserved for explicitly The method is used with a book value of assets, so that investment appreciation is taken into an investment reserve, and is not brought into the comparison between assets and liabilities when surplus is determined.

Hence the value of the call option represents the expected cost of the annuity guarantee provided by the company Put option Or use a put on an interest rate So if interest rates reduce below the implied guaranteed rate, the increased cost to the company of providing the guarantee is offset by an increase in the value of the put option.
This is a market-consistent approach to liability valuation and hence market values of assets would need to be adopted.
Part i was well answered by students who knew their bookwork.
Part ii was not well answered. Very few people mentioned the fact that method is used with book value of assets. Some students explained whether principles were met for non-profit business, which was not required in the question.
Part iii was poorly answered. Many students suggested that company should purchase these assets, instead of reading that it is a reserving strategy, not an asset-liability matching strategy.

## QUESTION 1

i. Uses:

- To update assumptions for product pricing, needed to ensure premiums/charges are robust to changes in withdrawal rates.

- As surrender values will be available, the rates can be used when setting surrender penalties. (Note: not in setting surrender values as the product is unit-linked)

- To detect (and understand) any trends.

- Make projections for the future.

- Set assumptions for reserving basis.

- Set assumptions for embedded value calculations.

- Analysis of surplus.

- Compare with industry experience and investigate any significant differences.

- Would allow the identification of any problematic products or distribution channels.

- The persistency of various distribution channels (or individual sales staff) can be incorporated in remuneration.

- Production of management information reports.

- May be required by legislation.

ii. Reasons:

- There may have been a change in the mix of business by a factor not identified as impacting withdrawals (e.g. sex, if sex was not one of the factors analysed).

- Withdrawal rates can be particularly affected by economic conditions:

- Increased unemployment leading to higher withdrawals.

- Lower rates following when economy improves.

- Withdrawals may increase if the fund is perceived to be producing relatively low returns relative to competitors.

- Withdrawals may also increase after period of very good fund performance, as policyholders may feel they have made a sufficient return.

- Economic conditions can also impact on the type of person effecting a policy, and hence their future propensity to withdraw.

- Extrapolation of past data may not be all that relevant over a long period of time as so much may have changed.

- The sales process, distribution channel or target market may change.

- New product launches by the company, or by competitors, can impact withdrawal rates.

## QUESTION 2

Implications:

- Policyholders will have developed expectations with respect to the:

- level; and

- volatility of the bonuses.

- PRE will have arisen from:

- past practice of company;

- marketing material, point of sale disclosure;

- communication accompanying previous bonus declarations;

- market practice.

- The practice of limiting smoothing will result in increased volatility, violating PRE.

- This increase in volatility also makes managing policyholder's expectations of a (relatively) smooth bonus rate going forward, more difficult.

- If policyholders wanted to share fully in the investment experience without smoothing, they would have taken out a unit-linked policy.

- In particular, if competitor's products provide a smoothed return, following a different strategy may be risky.

- However, some policyholders would prefer that surplus is distributed relatively earlier through higher reversionary bonus rates, which could have a positive impact on new business volumes.

- If the insurer were to adopt a lower volatility investment strategy, expected returns will be lower than before, which also violates PRE.

- A violation of PRE may have reputational and legal consequences for the insurer.

- The proposal means that terminal bonuses become the primary means of:

- smoothing benefit payouts, and

- allowing policyholders to share in mortality and expense experience.

- But policyholders will have also developed expectations as to the size of the terminal bonus relative to the reversionary bonuses.

- Any change in bonus distribution strategy would require careful communication.

- The change will create inequity between different generations of policyholders,

- e.g., if free assets have built up in recent years, it would be penal to policyholders not to distribute this in part through smoothing . (A different example could have been given.)

- This could be dealt with via terminal bonuses although this could create an expectation that is not sustainable. (Or any similar point about distribution of the estate)

- This bonus strategy would limit the deferral of surplus distribution which raises capital requirements.

- This may require an increase in product charges to meet the increased cost of capital, making the product relatively less competitive.

- Particularly as this is a mutual insurer and new business financing arises from the bonus distribution mechanism.

- Lower volumes would impact fixed expense recovery. § Especially as only the terminal bonus can be used to pass the expense risk on to policyholders. § And if charges on the unit-linked products are fixed. § Although the practice (of passing all the expense risk) onto unit-linked products could be inequitable and/or uncompetitive. Some candidates did not read the question and suggested that smoothing will be removed when the question stated that it would be reduced (i.e. some level of smoothing still takes place). These candidates therefore did not consider the impact of the proposal on terminal bonus rates. Stronger candidates were able to use the information supplied in the question to tailor their answers, e.g. for a mutual life office, the with-profit product range provides a source of capital and this proposal would have a negative impact on the available capital. Some candidates suggested that any existing surplus that has not been distributed yet would be released if this proposal is implemented. These candidates therefore suggested an increase in the solvency position of the company. However, this ignores the claim of the existing generation of policyholders on this surplus.

## QUESTION 3

i. It is likely that the distribution manager will want to reward brokers that:

- write high volumes of business for the insurer

- have access to particular target markets that are seem as key for future sales

- write more business with higher premiums / sums assured for insurer

- write business that has good persistency (including during the cooling-off period)

- write business that has good mortality experience

- perform some of the administrative tasks

- meet a certain standard of training/qualification which demonstrates their ability to sell in a knowledgeable way

ii. Advantages:

- The company will hope to attract more profitable business.

- Achieved through selling more business / business with better persistency / mortality / lower expenses.

- Could incentivise brokers to sell the desired types of business.

- Brokers will be sharing in the increased profits.

- May be an incentive for other brokers who currently don't work much with the company to become "key brokers".

iii. If the additional commission is not loaded for the insurer faces the risk of not making
sufficient additional profit to cover the additional commission.
Manage by:

- Loading for the additional commission.

- Only pay the extra commission if there is an improvement in experience.

- Could be justified as a (short term) marketing expense until the fruits of the exercise come through. There may not be the expected improvement in experience (mortality / persistency / expenses). Manage by:

- Monitoring experience by broker.

- The commission could be earned only when improved experience has been demonstrated.

- Commission clawback can be implemented if business does not meet required standards.

- Renewal commission could be included to reward brokers for good persistency of business. Premiums may become uncompetitive if additional commission has to be loaded for. Manage by:

- Monitor competitive position (premiums & commissions). Brokers may become unhappy, and stop selling your business, if they feel they have been put on the wrong (standard) commission scale. Manage by:

- Monitor broker performance to ensure that "key" brokers aren't being overlooked.

- Provide clear guidelines to brokers as to how they could qualify for the "key" status. It could result in brokers "mis-selling" policies just to ensure they get more commission or meet the "key broker" criteria. Manage by:

- Monitoring the broker performance especially lapses.

New business strain could increase if sales increase as a result of the new commission structure. This could result in the company's capital being put under strain.
Manage by:

- Reinsuring - financial reinsurance or quota share with nil premium payment period or high initial reinsurance commission.

- Asking shareholders for more capital to ensure that the growth is supported. It could start a commission "war" in the market as competitors match or better the commission you are paying. There is really nothing you can do to manage competitor's behaviour/response. Part (i) was well answered Part (ii) was reasonably well answered by most candidates. Part (iii) was generally poorly answered. Most candidates did not even mention the key point that if the additional commission was not loaded for it would result in lower profits. Many candidates only gave the risk but did not indicate how to mitigate the risk as asked.

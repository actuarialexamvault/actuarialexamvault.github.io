## QUESTION 4

i. Data checks:

- Reconcile policy data between the beginning and end of the experience period.

- Check policy movements (including alterations).

- By number, sum assured and premium.

- Carry out consistency checks with the recent data:

- Compare data to previous years.

- Compare with relevant data such as internal accounts.

- Check for consistency of term with premium, etc.

- Look for any unusual values.

- Carry out spot checks.

ii. Choose a period of investigation long enough to give credible results.
But not too long so as to mask the impact of the recent experiences.
Subdivide the data by:

- Product type (e.g. for level and decreasing sum assured products)

- Age

- Sex

- Location

- Lending institution

- Initial mortgage value

- Sum assured

- Dwelling type

- Occupation

- Income or marital status or socio-economic status For each homogeneous group, consider the contracts issued in the last financial year. The number of altered policies out of this cohort is divided by the exposure. Carry out a similar process for 2nd and subsequent years. Also check the average length of the extension for each homogenous group.

iii. A cash flow model can be used to project both assets and liabilities into the future,
The main steps to be taken are:

- Make a suitable assumption about amount and type of initial assets e.g. in relation to reserves plus assumptions about free capital.

- Estimate the liability experience for the next time period using expected future experience.

- Use a stochastic model for capital value changes and investment income on the various asset types over the same time period.

- Asset return assumptions should be consistent with the inflation assumptions used in the liability modelling.

- Determine statutory capital adequacy requirements and supervisory reserves at the end of the period having regard to the projected asset distribution.

- Repeat for as many future periods as required, and with lots of simulations of the investment returns.

- The statistical distribution of assets available to meet the liabilities each year can be determined.

- This can then be used to find the probability of insolvency given the strategy.

iv. Implications for investment strategy:

- Term:

- Longer term, so asset term may need to increase.

- A longer asset term suggests greater asset volatility.

- So may need to increase proportion of conservative assets.

- May wish to make a tactical switch to safer assets in any event, given current climate.

- Need to ensure the company is not over-exposed to property as an asset class.

- If free assets are sufficient, the company might be able to do nothing and accept the higher mismatching and reinvestment risk, especially if suitable longer dated assets are not available.

- If suitable longer dated assets are not available (e.g. government bonds) the company might be able to use derivatives to increase the duration of the assets.

## QUESTION 5

i. An Internal unit linked fund:

- Consists of a clearly identifiable set of assets, e.g. equities.

- Is divided into a number of equal units consisting of identical sub-sets of the fund's assets and liabilities. This division is notional.

ii. Principal risks:

- Unit prices are generally set at discrete points in time, whereas the underlying asset values effectively change continuously.

- This is a particular risk if:

- The underlying asset values are volatile, or

- If there is a sudden large movement in market values. A company's liabilities, dependent on the unit price, are therefore not exactly matched to the underlying assets. This timing delay introduces a pricing risk for the company, that needs to be managed.

- The unit price calculation would include some approximations, including:

- An allowance for tax on unrealised capital gains.

- An allowance for accrued asset and liabilities e.g. accrued interest not yet received.

- Estimates of the market value of assets, where the market value is not immediately observable e.g. property, as there is a risk that the actual values are very different to the estimates.

- There could be errors in the actual unit price calculations:

- Unit prices are based on the appropriation / expropriation prices of the underlying assets, depending on whether the company is creating additional (net) units or cancelling (net) units. There is a risk that the company uses the wrong basis when calculating the unit prices.

- There unit prices could be based on the incorrect data (e.g. the asset managers provided the incorrect market values of assets).

- There could be an error in the calculation routine.

- Although regulations generally do not specify how units are to be priced, regulations may restrict what policy charges, for example, may be included in the unit price. Any changes to regulation could be a risk to the company.

- The basic equity principle states that the act of creating/cancelling units should not affect the unit price. Any error could therefore violate this principle and lead to a negative market perception.

- In addition, approximations / errors may:

- Could negatively affect the company's reputation which in turn may negatively affect new business volumes / increase withdrawals.

- Allow policyholders to select against the company by disinvesting if they become aware that the unit price overstates the value of assets.

iii. Criteria:

- There must be a unit-related charge on the unit fund.

- This allows the company to hold less than the fully funded value of units in early years.

- Additional units can be purchased over the lifetime of the contract using unitrelated charges.

- Because the charge is unit-related, the portion of the unit charge that has been used for funding will be exactly sufficient to purchase the outstanding number of units, irrespective of any price movement of the underlying units.

- The charges that are not used for actuarially funding (including a portion of the unit charge and/or policy fees) should be sufficient to cover the renewal expenses on the contract.

- We would not want to be in a position where future (prudently predicted) cashflows are negative on a contract.

- Any shortfall between the ongoing charges and renewal expenses will be capitalised in the non-unit reserve.

- The face value of units should only be available on contingent events like death or survival.

- A unit-related surrender penalty is needed to reduce the unfunded value of the units to the funded value of the units.

- The unfunded value of units is mostly available on death, which still exposes the life company to some risk.

- Actuarial funding must be permitted by legislation. Most candidates struggled with this question with answers to part (ii), in particular, being very poor. The question referred to risks in determining the unit price (i.e. the actual calculation of the unit price). This should have been the focus of a candidate's answer. Some candidates only described the risks as a consequence of an incorrect unit price and therefore did not answer the question.

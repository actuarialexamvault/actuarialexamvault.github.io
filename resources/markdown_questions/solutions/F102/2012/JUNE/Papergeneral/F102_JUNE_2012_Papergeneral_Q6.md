## QUESTION 6

i. Cross-subsidies

- Within an age band.

- Premium rates do not differentiate by other known risk factors, for example:

- Smokers vs non-smoker. Smokers are more likely to be hospitalised and are therefore subsidised by the non-smokers

- Males vs females.

- Between healthy and ill on entry.

- Given that the initial underwriting is limited, there is significant scope for antiselection.

- The relatively healthy, cross-subsidise the less healthy.

- Between policies with benefits of different sizes.

- Depending on the methodology followed in loading for expenses, there is likely to be a cross-subsidy between small premium and large premium policies.

- There is also cross-subsidy between early and late withdrawals.

- Early withdrawals will not have repaid initial expenses and are therefore crosssubsidised by later withdrawals.

- A different premium structure e.g. annual premiums, could possibly reduce this cross-subsidy to some extent.

ii. Factors:

- Risk Characteristics:

- Any cross-subsidy in a product design increases risk because actual experience may be different to the assumption on the extent of cross-subsidy, e.g. we may get more smokers buying the product than assumed when we priced the product.

- The shareholders appetite for this additional risk should be considered.

- Some additional risk management measures may have to be introduced, e.g. limiting the maximum sum assured per policyholder.

- The company may want to consider a quota share reinsurance arrangement to share the business mix risk.

- Marketability:

- Potential policyholders may not like the idea that they may be cross-subsidising others in terms of health.

- However: § Simplifying the design (e.g. the age bands) means that the product is more marketable. § A simplified underwriting process, may also reduce new business administration.

- The product designer needs to weigh-up the benefit of simplicity against the additional risk due to the cross-subsidy.

- Competitiveness:

- Profitability:

- The premium should cover benefit payments, expenses and a profit margin.

- If there are cross-subsidies, the additional risk may mean that the product needs to be priced with a bigger profit margin requirement to compensate for the additional risk.

- The sensitivity of profits to changes in business mix may inform the decision on the size of the required margin.

- Guarantees:

- As premiums are guaranteed risk is increased, because the company will not be able to take corrective action of actual experience wrt cross-subsidies is different to expected.

- Financing Requirements:

- Cross-subsidies introduce additional risk, which may affect the solvency reserves required on the product, increasing capital required.

- This in turn affects the profit margin requirements for this product.

- Consistency with other products the company is already writing:

- If the company is selling a fully-underwritten version of this product, it may expose itself to selection risk if the healthier lives choose the alternative product.

- Regulatory requirements /professional guidance:

- May prevent a company from differentiating by some risk factor, e.g. gender.

- Forcing the life assurance company to accept the cross-subsidy risk. Other design factors not applicable to the question:

- Sensitivity of profit

- Administration systems, as this should not affect the extent of cross-subsidies Answers to this question were reasonable over all. Most candidates were able to identify a range of cross-subsidies in this product design, as required by part (i). The quality of answers to part ii varied. The weaker answers only described the design factors in general, whereas the stronger candidates described the impact of the cross-subsidies on these design factors.

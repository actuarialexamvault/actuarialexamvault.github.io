## QUESTION 7

i. Advantages:

- May improve business volumes of initial policy.

- If priced correctly, should improve profitability.

- Greater volumes may reduce expense recoupment / claims volatility.

Disadvantages:

- Anti-selection risk.

- Lives in poor health at the end of the term will want to exercise the option.

- There may be increased capital requirements resulting from higher reserves.

ii. Ways of reducing the risk:

- limit the total amount of sum assured available under the options

- restrict the choice of contract available under the options

- restrict the term of the carrier contracts

- limit the time available during which each option needs to be exercised

- ensure that any exclusions on the carrier contract also apply to all option contracts

- encourage all policyholders to take up the option, e.g. through reminder notices / automatic take-up

- keep the additional premiums required in respect of the option contracts low (to help achieve the last objective), although normal minimum premiums should still apply

- do not guarantee the premiums that will be offered on the option contracts

- underwrite initially as though option will be exercised

- price conservatively initially

- arrange for a suitable reinsurance treaty

- use lower retention limits than normal Note: "Extra Premiums" does not gain credit unless candidates indicated that any such extra premiums are levied on the carrier contract rather than on the option contract.

iii. Mortality rate

- This is the key assumption as you need to know how many additional deaths will be expected due to offering this option. In addition, the mortality rate up to the end of the term determines how many policies will still be in force.

- In order to determine who will survive to the end of the term, the mortality rate of the term assurance product can be used.

- To set the mortality rate post exercising the option, you could use the experience from other products though it is likely that this isn't going to be available as this is a new option being offered by the company.

- The mortality rate can be set by using the mortality rate for the term assurance pricing and making an assumption about worsening mortality due to anti-selective lapsation and take up.

- You could also ask a reinsurer for pricing assistance with the option as they are likely to have experience from other clients/markets. Lapse / Withdrawal

- Use the historical experience on the term assurance product.

- May decide on slightly lower lapses at the durations near the end of the term as some people who lapsed previously may now be incentivised to remain due to the option. Take up rate at end of term

- This is needed to know how many people will exercise the option .

- As we will have no experience on this, getting advice from a reinsurer or a consultant is probably the best way to set this assumption. Investment return

- The option premiums will need to be accumulated until the end of the policy term to pay for the additional death claims that will be incurred due to the extension being allowed without further medical evidence.

- If the company has a whole of life product it could use the same investment return as it uses in that pricing.

- Alternatively, the yield on gilts of a term equal to the average term policy issued would be appropriate.

- The yield should be lowered for reinvestment risk and taxation. Profit / Safety margin

- This would be required in order to ensure the option is profitable.

- The safety margin would be included as there will be significant uncertainty around some of the assumptions including the take up rate.

- As the option is more risky, you should use the profit margin for the term product plus an additional margin for the extra riskiness. Expenses

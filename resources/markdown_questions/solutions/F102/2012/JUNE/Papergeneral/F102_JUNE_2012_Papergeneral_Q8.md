## QUESTION 8

i. Advantages for the policyholder:

- Favourable overall morbidity or expense experience will be reflected in lower charges / premiums at policy reviews.

- Premium rates should be more competitive as there will be fewer margins built in.

- Surrender values, maturity values and death values are available.

- There should be some flexibility to vary benefit levels under in-force policies due to the risk premium approach to costing.

- The product could be packaged with other elements to meet overall needs, for example an increased death benefit. Disadvantages for the policyholder:

- If experience is poor the mortality or expense charges may be increased, resulting in lower unit-related benefits (i.e. death, surrender and maturity benefits) and pressure on premiums.

- Poor experience and increased charges may result in premiums being increased following the 5-yearly premium review, i.e. much of the risk is passed to the policyholder.

- The contract may be difficult to understand, e.g. the variability of charges, or why certain benefits are unit-linked and not others.

ii. The major features on which such contracts are sold are:

- the definition of sickness

- policy conditions, e.g. waiting period, deferred period, exclusions, rehabilitation clause, etc.

- level of cover available, including replacement ration and benefit escalations

- the level of charges / price

- the insurers willingness to pay claims / level of claims underwriting

iii. Expense risk:

- the risk is that the expense charges will not meet the expenses actually incurred

- can be significant owing to the long term nature of these contracts and the uncertainty regarding expense inflation

- the timing mismatch between initial expenses and the regular expense charges can pose a risk, particularly in respect of early withdrawals

- claims underwriting is an important (and expensive) aspect of this business, and can be difficult to estimate at outset

- the expense risk is exacerbated as this is a new type of business for the recentlyestablished insurer, making expenses difficult to estimate

- the extent to which charges can be varied may be limited by market pressure, PRE and regulation

- changes in the mix of new business from that anticipated is a risk as there are likely to be cross-subsidies involved in the expense recoupment

- lower than expected new business volumes is a risk as fixed expenses may not be adequately recouped

- too much new business may pressurise capital, and administration systems/procedures may need updating

iv. Risk Premium:

- Likely to have low retention limits initially.

- Will assist in reducing claim fluctuations, which is likely to be a problem for a recently established company entering a new market.

- May provide financing commission which would assist with new business strain.

- If written on a treaty, it could assist the insurer to accept large applications without excessive delays.

- The cost of the cover may be relatively low owing to the reinsurer's large risk pools and low margins (or other reasons, e.g. taxation). (Could be used as a reason with any form of reinsurance)

- To benefit from the reinsurer's technical assistance, which is of particular benefit here as the company is new to the market, and could include:

- access to rating data and advice

- advice on initial and claims underwriting

- product and system design suggestions (Could be used as a reason with any form of reinsurance) Individual Risk XL:

- Could be used to protect against individual claims of long duration. (It is not sufficient to say "protect against large claims", as the sizes of the claims are known at outset.) Aggregate (or Catastrophe) XL:

- Can reduce aggregations of claims caused by non-independence of risks.

- Could be used to cover injuries arising from a workplace accident. Unlikely to be available to cover diseases. Stop Loss

- Can protect against overall experience on the business being poor.

- A potential problem as the insurer is new to the market and will thus not have much experience or data for pricing.

The question was poorly answered on the whole.
In part (i) any candidates focused on the savings element of the contract which, as stated in the question, was relatively insignificant. There was no suggestion in the question of there being a range of unit funds to choose from, and the income benefit is not unit-linked. Many candidates listed generic advantages of unit-linked products, such as transparency and flexibility without explaining why they believed these to be relevant to protection policies.
Many candidates made no valid attempt at answering part (ii), choosing instead to simply describe the contract and its benefits.
In part (iii) many candidates, incorrectly, assumed that the expense charges were unit-linked (which was not stated in the question). Some candidates also claimed that expense charges were only variable every 5 years, and that it was the premium review that would mitigate expense overruns (when in fact it is the reviewability of expense charges that is the key). A few candidates wrote that large expenses are a risk - it is not the size of the expenses that poses the risk, but the difficulty in predicting them.

In part (iv) candidates were penalised for suggesting types of reinsurance which are inappropriate, such as Original Terms (Quota Share or Individual Surplus) - unless a depositback arrangement was included. No credit was awarded for Financial Reinsurance as this is not risk reinsurance.

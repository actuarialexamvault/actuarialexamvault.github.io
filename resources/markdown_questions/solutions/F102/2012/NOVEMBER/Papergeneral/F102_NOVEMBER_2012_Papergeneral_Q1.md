## QUESTION 1

(i)
Actively at work: an employee who is absent due to an accident or illness is ineligible for coverage until he or she returns to work.
Fall within free cover limits: amount of cover automatically granted without individual underwriting to members of a group scheme.
(ii)
Medical evidence can be obtained from the following sources: questions on the proposal forms reports from medical doctors that the applicant has consulted medical examination carried out by medical professional on behalf of insurer specialist medical tests on the applicant
(iii)
Need a reasonable volume of stable, consistent data; that can be used to deduce future experience and trends It is important to decide on the period for which data is collected (too short insufficient data, too long no longer relevant) Divide data into sufficiently homogeneous risk groups (use existing rating factors and other potential factors) Need sufficient data in groups to be credible Make adjustments for any trends in the data or unusual experience if necessary Determine the number of deaths relative to exposed to risk for each group Compare these rates to existing rates and industry norms May add margins for uncertainty to the rates
(iv)
By increasing the risk rates the company risks losing business Increase in premium may impact on the reputation of the company negatively Company may also lose business for employers where rates have not increased significantly and lose potential new business The company faces the risk that premium and investment income will not be sufficient to cover business expenses and finance new business plans Selective withdrawals: Risk that only schemes with very high mortality risk stay with the insurers resulting in future mortality experience being worse than expected Lower business volumes may result in higher claims volatility This questions was mostly bookwork and was well answered by most candidates.
Parts (i) and (ii) were straight forward bookwork and were well answered by most candidates. But several candidates failed to gain full marks for part (i) because they did not explain the underwriting implications for 'actively at work'.
Part (iii) was relatively straight forward and mostly bookwork. The question was well-answered for the most part. Students who scored well described the issues relating to the data as well as the process used for checking mortality rates for a group life scheme. Some students wasted time discussing applying credibility weighting factors to the data in detail.

Part (iv) required students to apply the principles discussed in the risks sections to the circumstances of the insurer. This question was relatively well answered, but most students failed to identify the full range of risks that the insurer could face. A few students failed to consider the issues relating to group life business and erroneously identified cost of providing surrender values as a risk to the insurer.

## QUESTION 2

(i)
The company will encounter additional new business strain as a result of writing more new business New business strain arises through High initial expenses (commission and administration costs) Reserves and capital required to support policies Levels of reserves and capital required will depend on the regulatory environment The insurer may also need additional margins for prudence in case experience is different than expected because they have not sold policies in these provinces before
(ii)
Reinsurance can reduce the financial risk associated with new business Through an increase in its available capital or Through a reduction in its financing requirement Reducing new business strain means that more new business can be written for the same amount of capital Original terms reinsurance (usually on a quota share basis) or financial reinsurance can be used e.g. an asset enhancing transaction Financial reinsurance of an existing block of business will improve the balance sheet of the company immediately by increasing the available capital (more new business may be written before the resulting new business strain leads to an unacceptably low solvency position) Any original terms reinsurance will mean some of the liability is passed to the reinsurer The company will need to hold lower statutory reserves (up to limits imposed by the regulator), reducing capital strain Initial reinsurance commission will make a contribution to the company's income, effectively discounting the future profits that will be tied up in the reinsurance premiums Quota share reinsurance gives the insurer greatest control over the amount of financing it will receive in relation to the volume of business Reinsurance is an important part of the company's strategy for financing the new business strain relating to the expansion of the products to other provinces Retention levels have to be set at a level that balances the need for support in financing new business strain and without giving too much of the business profit to the reinsurer.
The cost vs. benefit of reinsurance would need to be evaluated.
(iii)
A life insurance company could seek reinsurance to: Limit the amount paid on any particular claim Limit total claims payout Reduce insurance parameter risk Reduce claim payout fluctuations Smooth profits Receive technical assistance (e.g. risk and lapse rates etc) Get access to the reinsurer's u/w system and/or manual.

Increase profits (through regulatory or tax arbitrage) or return or risk-adjusted return on capital (by reducing risk cost or increasing volumes) Separate out different risks for products (eg investment and longevity risks for immediate annuity products) Allow aggregation of risks the cedant cannot manage on its own, so allowing manufacture of product lines The key point to part (i) was that there will be new business strain. Some students spent too much time addressing practical issues such setting up offices, distribution etc, which is missing the point of the question.
Part (ii) required a discussion of how reinsurance can relieve the pressure on solvency, especially with regard to the expansion. It did not ask for a generic discussion of benefits of reinsurance (see part (iii)), which is what some students embarked on, only to score poorly.
Part (iii) was straight forward bookwork. The instruction was to "state", not "discuss", advantages of reinsurance. Some spent too much time on discussing a point with the result being a too limited range of ideas to score well.

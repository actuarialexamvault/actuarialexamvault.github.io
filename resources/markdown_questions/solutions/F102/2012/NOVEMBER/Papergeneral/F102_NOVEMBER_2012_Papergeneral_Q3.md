## QUESTION 3

(i)
Demographic factors Sex: Both incidence and termination rates may differ by sex The exact nature of the difference will depend heavily on other factors Age: Disability incidence rates typically increase with age Termination rates as a result of mortality may also increase with age However, it is possible that fewer policyholders will return to work at older ages, reducing terminations Smoking status: Smoking status impacts negatively on the general healthiness and lifestyle of the policyholder.
This may cause both higher incidence rates and lower terminations However, higher terminations due to death could also be observed Policyholder occupation: Occupation has a clear impact on inception rates, for example it would only take a small injury to a surgeon's hand to cause disability compared to that for a manual labourer, but the manual labourer is more likely to be exposed to the risk of serious injuries while at work Termination rates can also depend on occupation, both as the result of the level of injury required to cause disability as well as the impact of job satisfaction in certain occupations relative to others Geographic region: Both incidence and termination rates will vary by geographic region For example, there may be more AIDS related disability claims in provinces with high HIV/AIDS prevalence rates. Terminations due to HIV/AIDS deaths may also be higher in such provinces Remote areas have limited access to medical care - termination rates lower due to recovery, but may be higher due to death Personal medical history/family medical history Some people are genetically more prone to diseases - will probably not be able to use this factor to rate on People who have been very sick in the past, are more likely to get sick again, and possibly stay sick for longer

(ii)
The main reasons for a deferred period are: To allow benefits to integrate with employer-supplied benefits To reduce the number of claims To reduce the cost of claims to the insurer, insurer's administration costs (and therefore the price/premium) To meet true customer needs; most policyholders would not need to submit a claim for a couple of days off with flu Will eliminate claims which are less severe Gives insurer time to implement rehabilitation procedures

(iii)
An increase in the deferred period may help to increase profitability: by reducing claims by reducing costs of administration However the change may not be suitable to HFB (the beneficiaries of the policy) if the deferred period becomes too long, as the change increases credit risk to them (clients get ill, stop work and default on mortgage payments) However nil deferred period may be too generous if it leads to claims from individuals who are only sick for a few days/weeks and then return to work When introducing deferred period, claim termination rate due to recovery will also probably be lower, because only really sick people will still be claiming after deferred period Although terminations due to death might increase Claims volatility reduces, hence reinsurance costs would reduce Lower statutory reserving requirements (as a result of all the benefits mentioned above) The comparison with other instalment protection products is not necessarily appropriate as in this case the purpose of the instalment protection is to protect the bank Introduction of deferred period may lead to lower sales because the fact that there was no deferred period gave bank and insurance company a competitive advantage Deferred period does not meet needs of self-employed who doesn't have employer-supplied benefits
(iv)
Product design Introduce reviewable without-profit premium rates, or change from non-profit to unit-linked with reviewable charges: This would allow an increase in premiums/charges in the event of deteriorating claims experience Lower guarantees should result in lower capital requirements, increasing return on capital Risk: If significant this could increase risk of lapse (and default on the mortgage) if premium increases become unaffordable (the premium payable already varies in line with mortgage repayments) Or selective withdrawals of healthy lives Change the occupational-based claims definition to be more strict: If the occupation-based definition results in claims but claimants are still able to work and earn an income, then the claims definition is too generous and needs to be changed.
Change from own occupation to own or any occupation Could use alternative incapacity criteria (e.g. FATs, ADLs, ADWs, PCAs) Risk: It is unlikely that an alternative incapacity criterion will be suitable as the linkage to earning capacity (weaker link between claim criteria and the ability to repay the mortgage loan than with an occupational-based criterion).
Rating Increase the premium rate.
Risk:
Fewer clients use HFB for their mortgages, leading to lower business volume for GHI (and HFB).
This is a particular risk if other banks do not require an instalment protection policy or if their premium rates are lower.

Underwriting Investigate the possibility of changing the underwriting.
There is currently no control over initial underwriting, as GHI is obliged to offer instalment protection to HFB's clients. Discussions could be held with HFB to see if there is any chance of changing this, or to ensure that lending criteria are not weakened.
Risk:
HFB would not want to lose its core business by introducing strict underwriting. This would also mean reduced business for GHI.
Claims management Reassess the current claims management policy.
Risk:
If claims management is made stricter, and some valid claims are repudiated it could result in lapses and mortgage default.
Expenses Try to streamline the administration function to reduce costs e.g. use of greater automation.
Risk:
Expense cuts could result in poorer servicing of policyholders, with associated complaints and poor public image.
Weaker claims management will have associated increased claims costs.
Required capital Change capital requirements, provided the directors are comfortable with lower capital levels. Consider whether capital buffer is unnecessarily high, especially compared to statutory minimum. Risk: Increased probability of insolvency and regulatory intervention.
Other points given: Introduce waiting period to reduce anti-selection risk - but could lead to lower sales Introduce proportional benefits to those who return to lower earning job - to encourage to return to work Linked-claims periods could be introduced to encourage people to return to work without fear that they would need to wait out another deferred period if they get sick again.

Rehabilitation services could be introduced during deferred period (and thereafter) to give people advice on how to get well which may help to improve claim termination rates.
Reinsurance can be taken out - reduces capital requirements - risk of default, and profits as well as losses shared with reinsurer Could get HFB to give clients a fixed interest rate rather than variable rate - reduces uncertainty reduces capital requirements.

Or provide fixed/reduced/proportional payments upon disability - but unlikely to meet policyholders needs or HFB's needs, because higher risk that mortgage repayments can't be made in full Students did not do well in this question. In part (i), many students saw 'demographic factors' and started listing demographic assumptions. Some students understood 'incapacity based on occupational definitions' as unable to do occupation due to losing your job, rather than due to illness.

In part (iii) many students failed to note the impact on HFB of introducing a deferred period.
Similarly, in part (iv), some students came up with good ideas of how to reduce expenses or claim costs, but didn't state that it increases the risk to HFB, and then didn't get the marks.

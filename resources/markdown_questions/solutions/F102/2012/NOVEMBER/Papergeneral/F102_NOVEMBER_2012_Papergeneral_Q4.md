## QUESTION 4

(i)
The surrender value will be the expected present value of the net future cashflows (claims + expenses less premiums) In calculating prospective reserves, assumptions will be needed for interest, expenses, expense inflation and mortality. It might also be necessary to make assumptions in respect of tax Interest This will be the most important assumption A company might consider the current weighted average redemption yield of suitable securities to be its best estimate assumption It may also consider the interest rate used in the premium basis if it wishes to use a blended basis Expenses Consider most recent expense investigation for renewal expenses May well be the same as those used to set current premium rates Allowance also needs to be made for the expenses involved in surrendering the policy Renewal commission could be allowed for as paid Inflation Chosen to be consistent with the investment return assumption Consider real return anticipated on index-linked government stock to give an indication of expected inflation Mortality The mortality basis chosen should reflect the future expected mortality of those policyholders who are surrendering (May be lighter than for policyholder who do not surrender) Although less risk here of selective withdrawals because forced to withdraw if moving to private sector (may be big portion of total withdrawals) Could track mortality experience of previously surrendered policies, but difficult since lapsed policies not tracked But for most assurance contracts that have surrender values the mortality assumption will not have a large effect upon the resulting value) It is unlikely that any margins would be included in the assumption as these will increase the surrender value Having computed prospective values, surrender value terms would need to allow for loss of future profits from such surrender Surrender penalties may also need to be considered.
Competitive pressures would need to be considered If best estimate assumptions used, all profit from non-surrendered policy would be made If premium basis assumptions used, profit made to date would be made SVs based on premium basis at start to best estimate basis closer to end would be common
(ii)
Low surrender values at early durations compared to premiums paid This may be contrary to policyholders reasonable expectations (depending on the policy documentation and industry practice) It may also seem unfair because policyholders are forced to surrender if they change employment to the private sector

May lead to poor reputation and low sales Also risk the intervention of regulator if low surrender values/severe penalties are reported to regulator and the regulator deems that intervention is necessary due to unfair treatment of policyholders The losses on surrenders at short durations would have to be cross-subsidised by profits at later durations the company risks making losses if the mix of surrenders at early and late durations is different to the assumptions used in determining the surrender basis and penalties Financial risk of withdrawals at early durations when asset share is negative Very many students listed the 'principles of setting surrender values' rather than the 'assumptions' to be used when determining surrender values.

## QUESTION 5

(i)
Use of option prices Maturity guarantee is a European style put option corresponding to the maturity value.
Surrender and death guarantees are a American style put option.
It is difficult to ensure that the whole investment fund corresponds to a single option traded in the market.
Approximations may be used using combinations of market indices for bonds and equities.
Stochastic simulation A stochastic model of the rates of return on investments is used to simulate the future price of assets.
The assumptions underlying the model need to be consistent with the planned investment strategy.
Assumptions on the rate of exercising the option based on expected policyholder behaviour will need to be made.
A large number of simulations will need to be performed in order to obtain reliable estimates.
These simulations will generate a probability distribution of the PV of the cost of the option.
The insurer can select the required loading for the cost of the option at a level where there is a high probability that the loading will be sufficient.
(ii)
The cost of the minimum death and maturity guarantees needs to be funded from the charges (unallocated premium and annual management charge).
Expenses, cost of capital and profit to the company are also funded by charges.
Expenses relating to this product will include: Initial expenses: commission, sales and marketing related expenses, initial policy set up costs Ongoing expenses: ongoing management costs, investment costs Maturity/ termination costs: administration on maturity or termination of policy The amount deducted as charges will start at quite a low level, and then grow each year as the fund increases.
Timing of expenses, cost of capital and cost of investment guarantees are not well matched by the current charging structure of the policy.
Initial commission on policy is large and payable for the first two years of the policy Sales and marketing costs and initial set up costs will be probably expressed as a premium related cost that will also be at the start of the policy Renewal expenses will be expressed as a per policy cost and paid annually Initial charges are likely to be insufficient to cover initial costs Early surrender will result in a loss to the insurer Fixed and overhead costs and claims and termination costs are not matched by any specific charges, but are likely to be small Investment costs are likely to be expressed as a percentage of the fund each year (matched to fund charge) Charges at the start of the policy will not cover the initial costs of the insurer and cost of capital strain.
Charges at later durations are likely to be greater than the ongoing costs and investment costs.
The annual management charges, being a percentage of fund, leaves the company exposed to stock market fluctuations particularly at later durations when the majority of the charges will be of this form.

The charging structure may well meet the company's profit criteria, but it is not very capital efficient and so is only viable if the company has access to plenty of capital.
(iii)
Use of Actuarial Funding Actuarial funding is a technique whereby insurers can hold lower unit-reserves for unit-linked contracts and thus reduce new business strain... ... by taking credit for some of the extra future annual management charges (above those required to meet ongoing expenses) by actuarial funding. .
It is usual to hold unit funds that exactly match the value of units purchased.
However, the full value is only needed at surrender, maturity or death.
It is therefore possible to hold the actuarial present value of the unit fund rather than the fully funded value.
If UF is the fully funded number of units purchased at time t, then the amount needed to be held is t UF A (1- UF A can be transferred to the non-unit fund). t x+t:15-t t x+t:15-t The discount rate should be less than or equal to the annual fund management charge in order to meet future obligations.

Actuarial funding will create extra cashflow into the non-unit fund, particularly at early duration which will help to reduce new business strains.
Future fund management charges are converted to cash at the outset of the policy, which is a better match to the initial expenses.
But the company needs to ensure that amount held in the unit fund is sufficient to pay out the value of units on surrender, as it does not hold sufficient units.
Need to check whether the surrender value (taking into account the surrender penalty and the surrender terms offered to the policyholder) is in line with the actual units held.
Part (i) required candidates to identify and describe the methods to price the guarantees on the product. Most candidates identified the methods correctly. Stronger candidates were able to provide detail on how the methods could be applied Part (ii) required candidates to assess the degree to which expenses and charges were matched.
Candidates performed exceptionally poorly in this question. Many provided unnecessary detail on the implications of the weaknesses on the insurer rather outlining the actual weaknesses of the charging structure.
Part (iii) was straight forward bookwork, nevertheless a large number of students did not get full marks for this part.

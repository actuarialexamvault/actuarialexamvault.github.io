## QUESTION 6

(i)
The liability under a with-profits policy is partly guaranteed in monetary terms (the basic sum assured and reversionary bonus, once declared) and partly discretionary.
In terms of the discretionary component the insurer would aim, as far as possible, to invest to provide returns that meet with the reasonable expectations of policyholders.
PRE is influenced by marketing material and returns on similar products in the market But policyholders who take out a with-profits policy will expect the proceeds to maintain their value in real terms.
An appropriate investment strategy for these liabilities would have been a mix of fixed-interest securities, equities and index-linked bonds.
But the high proportion of terminal bonuses will imply a higher proportion of equities.
The level of freedom that the insurer has to depart from a fully matched strategy will depend on the level of free assets.
(ii)
A decision will be required in respect of the equitable distribution of existing surplus in the withprofit fund. (e.g. The surplus could be distributed to current policyholders via a special reversionary bonus.) The implications for the fund going forward and possible reactions from the insurer will depend on the current level of reversionary bonuses targeted by the company.
As the company distributes a large portion of the surplus via terminal bonuses current reversionary bonus rates are likely to be low, and thus the proposed guarantee is likely to lead to an increase in reversionary bonus rates and hence lower terminal bonuses.
The level of free assets is likely to be reduced in the future More working capital may be required for these policies.
The shareholders may require an increase in capital charges because of the guarantee.
In addition the guarantee is more onerous if the with-profit fund also participates in mortality/expense experience (poor mortality/expense experience could lead to the CPI guarantee biting).
Insurer may change the investment strategy to match the guarantee introduced new regulatory requirements E.g. more inflation-linked bonds to match the CPI guarantee.
Matching investments may not be available in the investment market This will have associated costs.
The change may come at an inopportune time e.g. if asset values are currently depressed.
Because this guarantee applies to the industry as a whole, the demand for inflation linked bonds may increase, making these assets relatively more expensive.
Tax payments are accelerated because of the realisation of assets.
The level of investment freedom and the ability of the insurer to maintain a mismatched investment strategy is constrained by the level of free assets of the insurer.
The changes will have to be communicated to existing policyholders and agents/brokers, increasing costs.
Policyholders may value the additional security provided through regular declarations of bonuses relating to CPI.

But the change the investment strategy with its resulting costs may reduce overall benefits for policyholders.
There may also be an increase in premiums due to cost of guarantee.
Because historically most of the bonus has been distributed via terminal bonuses, it is likely that some policyholders may not want the guarantee / possible increase in premium / possible change in investment strategy, which could lead to.
An increase in withdrawal rates.
Decrease in new business volumes.
This in turn may result in an increase in per policy expenses.
The company may withdraw from the with-profit market.
Note:
Because this change applies to the industry, no marks are available for comments relating to the change in competitive position.
Part (i) was fairly straight forward application of bookwork and a number of candidates answered the question adequately. Candidates who scored well were able to discuss the investment strategy in relation to guaranteed and discretionary benefits and identified that investments were likely to be weighted towards equities.
Part (ii) was poorly answered. Many candidates failed to discuss the issues relating to the distribution of the current surplus or the need to communicate the change to policyholders. Better candidates discussed the possible impact of the change in regulation on the insurer and policyholders and their possible responses in detail. A number of candidates wasted time repeating points that they had made in the discussion of the impacts of the new regulations in their later discussion on the possible responses of the insurer, which shows poor planning.

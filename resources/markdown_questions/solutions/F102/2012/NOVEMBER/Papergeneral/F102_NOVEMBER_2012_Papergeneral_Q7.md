## QUESTION 7

(i)
General These two policy objectives may be in conflict.
Setting financial soundness requirements at a more prudent level will give more protection to policyholders, But may be too onerous to encourage the expansion of the industry. A balance must therefore be reached in achieving these objectives.
Valuation of policyholder liabilities The method of valuing the liabilities could prescribe the gross premium valuation method. For simpler products a net premium valuation can also be used.
For a developing country, it is likely that products would be simple, with low guarantees.
For this type of business approximate methods may be suitable.
The reserves must be sufficient to cover future cashflows: guaranteed benefits (guaranteed surrender values, non-unit reserves, options, past declared and future bonuses) expenses; including commission Expected future premiums should be allowed for.
Need to consider allowance for reinsurance.
Assumptions including the discount rate, demographic, withdrawal and expense assumptions should be chosen on prudent basis (margin on best estimate).
Valuation of assets Asset valuation method may be prescribed e.g. use of market value or discounted cashflow method.
The basis may be prescribed e.g. for market value: bid, offer or mid market price.
Limits on admissible assets for valuations purposes to promote adequate diversification.
Solvency capital requirements Solvency capital provides an additional level of protection for policyholders.
Solvency capital should reflect the extent of prudence in the liabilities (more a prudent liability implies a lower solvency capital requirement).
The regulatory framework can include an approximate simple method for solvency capital (like a percentage of liabilities).
Alternatively, a more complex method for determining solvency capital that reflects the amount of risk of the business written may be used.
This includes lapse, surrender, investment, mortality risk etc.
(ii)
Possible regulatory restrictions: Restrict the terms and conditions of product designs, e.g.
 - Minimum term of policies.

 - Maximum surrender penalties.

 - Give policyholder the right of cancellation. Restrict the premiums or charges that can be used for some contracts. Restrictions on the channels through which life insurance may be sold. Requirements as to the procedures to be followed/information required to be given as part of the selling process, e.g.

 - Charges

 - Illustrated maturity values

 - Restrict the ability to underwrite or differentiate between classes of policyholders, e.g. restrict use of genetic testing

 - Disallow use of gender as a rating factor

(iii)
An investment analyst aims to assess both the current financial position as well as the likely future performance of life insurers. This will allow them to recommend buy or sell opportunities to potential investors.
In order to achieve this, the investment analyst will compare his estimate of the value of an insurer to the share price.
A valuation might comprise the following elements: The embedded value of the insurer.
 - The embedded value represents the future profit stream of the company's existing business together with the value of any net assets separately attributable to shareholders. A value for goodwill (based on a valuation of future new business)

 - Future expected future dividend projections (taking into account the regulator's requirements for dividends declared) The investment analyst is expected to use a risk adjusted basis Future new business opportunities are important in these assessments. The regulator will be concerned with the insurer's ability to meet policyholder obligations in the future The financial soundness of the insurer will be assessed according to whether the insurer meets the required minimum solvency margin as set out in the regulations usually on a prudent basis. Future new business is less important. However future new business plans become important for insurers that are not solvent or barely solvent, as new business will require capital which may not be available to the insurer and which may reduce solvency even further. The regulator will also be less concerned with the embedded value and future dividend payments to shareholders. (Provided dividends do not threaten solvency) Part (i) required students to apply the principles of reserving and solvency requirements to a developing insurance market. But few candidates covered all the issues that needed to be considered i.e. regulatory objectives, reserving principles, valuation of assets and solvency requirements. Although the discussion of the principles of reserving was bookwork there were a number of candidates that failed to discuss these principles. Candidates also gave too much detail on individual elements of the reserving calculation (e.g. allowance for bonuses) and then did not discuss the full range of principles. Part (ii) was well-answered, candidates who mentioned the type of restriction supported by an example scored well. Part (iii) was poorly answered. Many candidates failed to discuss the future profitability of the insurer and embedded value as an important consideration for the investment analyst.

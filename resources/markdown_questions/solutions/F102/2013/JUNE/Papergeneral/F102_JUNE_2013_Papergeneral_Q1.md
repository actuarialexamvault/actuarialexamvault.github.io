## QUESTION 1

i. Factors to consider:

- The investments of the insurer should be appropriate to the nature, term and currency of its liabilities.

- The investments should also be selected so as to maximize the overall return on the assets (income and capital), subject to the risks being taken being within the financial resources available to it.

- The extent to which the company may depart from investing in appropriate investments in order to match its liabilities, depends amongst other things on the extent of the company's free assets.

- Since the liabilities of this business are fixed in monetary terms, the most suitable match for these liabilities would be fixed income assets such as government bonds and corporate bonds.

- However, if the company is looking to enhance the profitability of this business through maximizing returns, it may want to consider retaining or increasing the equity proportion of the assets underlying the business.

- However, investing in equities will increase the risk of the assets not being able to meet the liabilities:

- Hence the company should consider how much free assets it has and how much of these it is willing to use as a cushion against this risk.

- This consideration should also involve looking at the other products that the company has and how much risk it has on its books from those businesses.

- The company may also use a greater proportion of corporate bonds to back these liabilities instead of using only government bonds keeping in mind the additional returns that these bonds provide in respect of the additional default risk.

- The company may also consider investing a certain proportion of the fund in index linked assets such as index linked bonds to meet the expenses outgo arising out of this business.

- A combination of equities and fixed interest may also be used to match inflationlinked expenses, provided the equity holding does not lead to unacceptable risk.

- The company should also ensure that the term of the fixed income assets is in line with the term of the liabilities, and that the currency of the assets and liabilities is the same.

- The company should also consider whether it wants to start writing business in this fund again or simply run the fund as a closed book which will affect the liquidity requirements of the fund which need to be taken into account within the investment strategy.

- The company should also adhere to any internal guidelines as well as external regulations pertaining to investments allowed in such policyholder funds such as those pertaining to the kind of assets that can be invested.

ii. Matching process:

- The matching of assets and liabilities can be established by carrying out projections of asset and liability cashflows at regular intervals.

- The above should be carried out for a range of scenarios.

- Stochastic techniques should be used at least for the assets and potentially some aspects of the liabilities cashflows such as lapses.

- The above scenarios should be used to identify the extent of cashflow and duration mismatch between assets and liabilities and how they compare to the threshold identified by the company as to the maximum mismatch that the company is willing to accept.

- A similar methodology could be used to assess the need to modify the investment strategy by either changing the kind of assets or the terms/currencies of the existing assets. This question was reasonably well answered in general. For part (i) a few candidates answered this question from the perspective of with-profits business, and made points about discretionary benefits and policyholder reasonable expectations. Many candidates mentioned that corporate bonds may be used as an alternative to government bonds to enhance returns, however very few made the point that part of the excess returns from corporate bonds is compensation for higher default risk. In part (ii) too many candidates focussed on particular features of the projection model, rather than on the overall process.

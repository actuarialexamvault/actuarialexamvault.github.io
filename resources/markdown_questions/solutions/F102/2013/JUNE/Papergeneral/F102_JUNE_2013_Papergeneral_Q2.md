## QUESTION 2

i. Factors to consider:

- Expected claims distribution (and claims volatility).

- Expected volumes of business.

- Other in-force life cover.

- Experience on other reinsurance.

- The confidence and familiarity of the company in underwriting this business.

- Other products' retention levels.

- Impact on regulatory capital requirements of different retention limits.

- Risk appetite of the company.

- Free assets of company.

- Importance of a stable free asset ratio to the company.

- Price of reinsurance.

- Whether a profit share is included.

- Impact of various retention limits on profitability and probability of insolvency.

ii. Use a questionnaire only (including medical and non-medical questions).
Problems with this:

- Non-disclosure by applicants is possible

- Questionnaire might not cover everything that needs to be asked.

- Applicant might not be aware of their medical condition.

- Questionnaire may need to increase in length

- Success will be dependent on sound claims underwriting. Price conservatively to recognise the risk of anti-selection. Problems with this:

- Might not be possible to price sufficiently for the anti-selection, as the selective effect may just get worse the higher the price and you may just end up with a lot of sick people only.

- Makes the product very expensive and possible unmarketable. Impose a pre-existing condition exclusion. Problems with this:

- You are relying on claims underwriting, and you might not be able to identify and/or prove all cases at claims stage.

- In addition, claims underwriting can be very unpopular and have negative marketing consequences. Apply a waiting period or accident-only period for cover. Problems with this:

- While it removes the risk of immediate claims due to anti-selection it doesn't remove the risk of people with generally poor health selecting against you.

- As policyholders may need the cover from outset this may not meet their needs.

- Could pose a reputational risk if deemed unfair. Only accept cases where people have recently (e.g. within the last year) gone for medicals for insurance purposes (either with your company or another company). Problems with this:

- It severely restricts the size of the market you can sell the product to.

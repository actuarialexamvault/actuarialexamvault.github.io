## QUESTION 3

i. Reasons why surplus may be less than expected:

- Mortality was lighter than assumed in the valuation basis, i.e. fewer deaths occurred. This could be due to random fluctuations or due to medical advances. This resulted in more annuity payments being made than expected, and a higher than expected reserve at the end of the period since more policies than expected survived the year.

- Investment returns were lower than assumed in the valuation basis resulting in a lower asset share at the end of the valuation period. The yield curve will have moved during the period. A mismatching loss will have occurred if the increase in reserves due to the change in yield curve exceeds the difference between actual and expected returns.

- Actual expenses were higher than assumed in the valuation basis. This resulted in the assets backing the policies being less than expected.

- Strengthening of the reserving basis leading to an increase in reserves. This can be the result of an experience investigation and consistent losses in the past, with the expectation that this will continue into the future or new regulations prescribing the reserving basis.

- New business strain on new policies issued, since the reserve at the end of the year exceeded the asset share on new policies written. This would typically be caused by margins in the reserving basis, rather than the business being priced unprofitably.

- Prior errors in the valuation data or model requiring correction may lead to increased reserves and a loss on the valuation basis.

ii. Steps that could be taken:

- Firstly a thorough analysis of surplus needs to be carried out to determine the source(s) of the lower than expected surplus.

- If it is found that the reasons are once-off (e.g. a particularly poor bond market performance due to adverse market movements), you may opt to do nothing in the anticipation of it not being repeated. This will have no effect on the EV.

- If it is found that the valuation basis is too weak and does not reflect experience expected in future, the basis may be strengthened where necessary to increase the reserves, for example.

- Mortality could be reduced.

- The investment return assumption may be reduced.

- The expense assumption could increase.

- If the loss was caused by once-off items, and the valuation basis is considered overlyprudent, the basis may be weakened to reduce the loss for the year, however future valuation results will be less favourable due to the weaker basis. The impact of this action will be to increase the embedded value (net asset value increases by more than the margin reduction in the reserves). Other steps that may be taken include:

- Re-price the product. This will improve the EV of new policies only.

- Change investment strategy to increase investment returns. This will not have an immediate effect on the EV but may lead to higher profits and hence higher EV in future (assuming no change to assumptions).

- Implement measures to cut expenses. This will not have an immediate effect on the EV but may lead to higher profits and hence higher EV in future (assuming no change to assumptions).

- Ensure that adequate procedures are in place to identify and process annuitant deaths. Under-reporting of annuitant deaths can be a significant operational risk. This question was handled very poorly by most students. In part (i) most students indicated that the loss is due to experience being worse than "pricing assumptions" or "expected levels" (not indicating what expectations, probably because they didn't know and didn't want to commit themselves, or worse, didn't realise that there are different levels of expected assumptions, depending on purpose). Many students were careless and used vague statements like "mortality experience was poor" or "mortality experience was worse than expected" without providing greater clarification. "Errors in the data/model" earned no credit without further clarification. For part (ii) a surprising number of students suggested that the basis can be weakened to eliminate the loss, without providing any further justification. In general this is not a viable option to reduce the reported loss, as while it will improve the result for the year in which the basis is weakened, it will make future valuation results less favourable.

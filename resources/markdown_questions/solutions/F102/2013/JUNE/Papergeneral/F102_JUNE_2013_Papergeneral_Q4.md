## QUESTION 4

i. Advantages:

- Such a standardization would have to be agreed by the various insurers, so the companies' expertise would be pooled to come up with the best solution.

- There will be a sharing of current and future expertise on the topic of medical advances, which will bring costs down for the various players in the market.

- This could lead to quicker (and hence cheaper) claims settlement, because there should be less room for dispute.

- From a marketing perspective, standardized definitions could result in:

- easier comparisons between different companies' products;

- improved explanations by the salesforce;

- better understanding by policyholders of the products;

- possible improvements in sales.

- Standard definitions should make it easier to collect industry wide data, which should lead to better information on which to base pricing.

- These benefits also apply to reinsurers.

ii. Product design:

- In order to pay at different levels for a condition, the benefit design will require different levels of severity to be specified.

- Each level of severity will have its own level of cover.

- Each level of severity for a condition would require medical claim qualification criteria.

- Under the existing product, cover is likely to cease when the claim is made.

- This is also likely to happen if the new product makes a claim at the full sum assured amount.

- The new product design should specify:

- how cover is reduced/ reinstated after partial claim, and

- what happens if a milder condition progresses to a more serious one.

- In light of the possibility of a wider range of claims that could be made under the new product, one can expect that there may be different/stricter underwriting requirements for the new benefit.

- The impact on administration and system requirements will need to be considered. Pricing:

- The current product requires an incidence rate per condition by age.

- The new product will require an incidence rate per condition, per severity by age.

- It can be argued that in light of the wider range of possible claims, there may be more expected claims administration expenses.

- The new product is likely to need higher margins owing to the greater uncertainty relating to claims experience.

iii. This is not necessarily the case

- At the most basic level, it is not stated whether the products cover the same conditions, so one cannot make a conclusion.

more frequently than 100% claims, and that the difference in tier level is made up by the increase incidence of claims.

- Underwriting, product development costs and admin expenses may be higher for a tiered product than a product without tiered benefits, leading to higher expense loadings on the office premiums. A wide range of answers was given for this question. Overall performance was poor, although many candidates did answer parts of the question reasonably well. Several candidates gave generic comments such as "consider reinsurance, regulatory requirements" etc., which did not gain credit.

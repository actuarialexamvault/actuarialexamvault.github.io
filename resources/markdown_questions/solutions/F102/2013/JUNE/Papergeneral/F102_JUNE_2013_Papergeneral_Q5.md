## QUESTION 5

i. Calculation of the asset share:

- Asset share is the accumulation of monies in less monies out.

- Monies in include:

- Investment income at the actual rate of return (incl. an allowance for unrealised capital gains).

- Premiums.

- Share of profit from other business (e.g. without-profits business), if applicable.

- Monies out includes:

- Expenses on the contract, incl. commission.

- Cost of benefits, incl. guarantees and options.

- Tax on investment income, net of any expense relief.

- Transfer of profits to shareholders.

- Cost of capital necessary to support contracts.

- A contribution to free assets supporting smoothing.

ii. Regular Reversionary Bonus:

- Usually declared annually.

- Once declared it is guaranteed.

- Options include simple, compound and super-compound, where:

- Simple: % of Sum Assured

- Compound: % of (Sum Assured + Bonus already declared)

- Super-compound: % of Sum Assured + different % of Bonus already declared

Terminal Bonus:

- Bonus that is declared on a claim event (i.e. maturity, death or possibly on surrender).

- The bonus could be:

- % of Sum Assured; or

- % of (Sum Assured + Reversionary Bonus).

- Used to distribute volatile sources of surplus such as capital gains and from other sources such as withdrawal and mortality if policyholders share in these profits. Special Reversionary Bonus:

- Bonus declared on an ad-hoc basis.

- Used to distribute surplus from sources that are unlikely to arise again (e.g. surplus from a demutualisation exercise).

iii. a. Impact on policyholders

- Equity:

- The reversionary bonuses may need to be lower due to poor recent returns to maintain equity between existing policyholders and new policyholders.

- Given that most of the profits historically were distributed with a terminal bonus, the reversionary bonuses may not have caused any over-distribution and the existing rates may thus still be equitable.

- However, if the data error resulted in an over declaration on reversionary bonuses in the past, this may mean that the current level of reversionary bonuses are inequitable, which further justifies a reduction in reversionary bonus rates.

- PRE:

- Due to policyholder reasonable expectations, lowering the bonus rates may need to be done slowly over a number of years.

- The company may be able to justify lower bonuses due to returns being lower as a result of the recession. This may mean that policyholder reasonable expectations are still being met.

- However, this may not improve the free asset position as quickly as required as lower reserves will only result if the expected future bonuses included in the prospective reserve calculation are reduced.

- Free assets and investment strategy:

- The lower free assets will result in decreased investment freedom which may lead to a shift of the assets to less risky investments.

- This may further lower the long term return expectations, necessitating a decrease in the reversionary bonus rate.

- Market Conditions:

Impact on shareholders:

- Lower reversionary bonuses will result in lower profits being transferred to shareholders.

- However, given that most profits are distributed by the terminal bonuses, reducing the reversionary bonus rate may have a relatively small impact on profit transfers to shareholders (depending on the extent of the reduction in the reversionary bonus). b. Impact on policyholders

- Equity and PRE:

- Distributions to policyholders should be equitable. The higher asset share previously may have resulted in an over declaration to previous policyholders i.e. previous terminal bonuses were too high.

- The statutory actuary will need to consider whether it is equitable to lower bonuses as a result of the error (only).

- The company may be liable to pay out the additional amounts lost due to inequitable distributions.

- Given the past practice of the company, policyholders (and financial advisors), would have develop some expectation of terminal bonus levels (even though terminal bonus rates are likely to be more volatile than reversionary bonus rates). Reducing the terminal bonus may affect PRE as a result.

- Given that terminal bonus rates are generally more volatile than reversionary bonus rates, the company probably has more scope to reduce terminal bonus rates (compared to reversionary bonus rates).

- This reduction in bonus rate will have a relatively large impact on claims (e.g. due to maturity) in the short-term.

- The needs of these policyholders, in particular, may not be met (e.g. if the product was supposed to repay the capital on a home loan).

- Surrender Values:

- Surrender values may not fully reflect the terminal bonuses.

- If the data error causes reputational damage and there are a large number of withdrawals, surrender profits may be possible which may improve the free asset position of the fund.

- This may however, affect equitable distribution of profits.

- Free assets and investment strategy:

- If the valuation assumption for terminal bonuses is decreased the free asset position may improve.

- Market Conditions:

- The recession is likely to result in lower returns decreasing terminal bonuses.

Impact on shareholders

- The lower terminal bonus rates will result in lower earnings being generated for shareholders and if the company cannot sustain its current dividends, the dividend declarations will decrease. The following points are relevant to both a. & b.:

- May have a negative impact on the share price, affecting shareholders. It may also make it more difficult for the company to raise sufficient capital in the future.

- This may lead to:

- an increase in surrenders;

- future new business being lost to competitors if competitors are declaring higher bonuses;

- making it more difficult for the company to cover its fixed expenses. The majority of candidates scored well in parts (i) and (ii), which were standard bookwork questions. Part (iii) was a challenging question and answers were generally poor. Candidates that did not do well on this question typically gave a very limited range of distinct points and/or did not use the information provided in the question. Some candidates suggested that a reduction in reversionary bonus rates would allow the company to adopt a more aggressive investment strategy.

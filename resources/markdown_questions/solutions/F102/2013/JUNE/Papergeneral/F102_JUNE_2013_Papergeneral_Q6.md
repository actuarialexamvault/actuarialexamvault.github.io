## QUESTION 6

i. An analysis of surplus will show the sources underlying the total profit. For items of
experience, the profit will be based on the difference between actual experience and expected (as per valuation basis).
If any of the items appear to be significantly different from the prior valuation, then this could indicate a problem with the data.
Specific checks:

- Check for unusual/unrealistic values in the analysis.

- Check the ratio of new business profit to premium income for new business (new business margin) - if this has changed in an unexpected way from last time, this could be due to a data problem.

- Check experience profit items against accounts e.g. mortality, surrender, expenses profit/loss against benefit payments in the accounts and compared to prior valuation.

If the sum of the components does not add up to the total profit (calculated from the change in total liabilities and assets), i.e. if there is "unexplained" profit/loss, this could indicate data errors.
ii. In general the statutory valuation basis is likely to be more prudent than the pricing basis.
Mortality:

- Valuation basis is likely to have higher rates. Investment return:

- Valuation basis is likely to include a lower return assumption.

- The low reserves on these policies mean that this is not one of the important assumptions. Expenses (and expense inflation):

- Valuation basis is likely to assume higher expenses.

- Also likely to assume higher expense inflation.

- The gap between investment return and inflation will be lower in the valuation basis.

- Variable expenses, e.g. commission, are likely to be the same in both bases. Tax:

- Likely to be the same in both bases. Lapses:

- Needs to be more conservative for reserving, but depending on various factors a higher or lower lapse assumption could be more prudent. Items not normally part of the valuation basis:

- Initial expenses.

- Initial commission.

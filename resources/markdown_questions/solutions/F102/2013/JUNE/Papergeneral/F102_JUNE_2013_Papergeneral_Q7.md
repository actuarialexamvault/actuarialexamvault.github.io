## QUESTION 7

i. Reasons:

- The earned asset share (EAS) per policy is, broadly speaking, the accumulated value of premiums less the policy's share of actual benefits and expenses paid, and is an estimate of the assets available per policy.

- Profit on surrender is equal to the EAS per policy less the surrender benefit paid.

- The profit on surrender is thus zero when the surrender benefit paid is equal to the

EAS.

- The minimum surrender benefit is zero, which means that there is always a loss on a surrender when the EAS is negative (early on in the policy term).

- The original pricing basis will include margins and profit loadings (i.e. the pricing basis is prudent).

- The difference between the EAS and the prospective reserve on the premium basis represents the accumulated value of the historic margins and profit loadings included in the premium.

- If the surrender value paid is similar to the prospective reserve on the premium basis, the insurance company retains the difference between the margins included in the premium basis and actual experience, which generally would lead to a profit.

- If the actual experience is worse than expected (incl. margins), a loss will be incurred on surrender.

- The difference between the prospective reserve on the realistic basis and the prospective reserve using the pricing basis represents the present value of future margins included in the pricing basis.

- If the surrender value paid is similar to the realistic reserve, the difference between the EAS and the realistic reserve represents the current value (at date of withdrawal) of both historic and future margins.

- The above analysis can be used to guide the company in its decision on what is a fair amount of profit to extract when it decides on the actual surrender value basis.

ii. The following are principles that apply to all alterations

- PRE

- Early on the SV is zero, which means that the policyholder essentially just buys a new policy.

- Policyholders may find this unacceptable.

- Profit Contribution

- The premium for reduced Sum Assured is based on the current new business rates and the alteration would be consistent with the margins on new business.

- In addition, profit is being extracted by the use of the Surrender Value:

- Because the reserve on the premium basis is used, historic margins are retained by the company.

- In addition, because the original pricing basis is used to spread the surrender value, the margins included in that pricing basis should emerge in the future.

- Expenses

- No allowance appears to be made for expenses incurred on the alteration.

- There is a double-counting of initial expenses, because the new business premiums include a loading for these expenses.

- However, there is no allowance for the cost of alteration, which partially offsets the double-counting of initial expenses.

- Boundary Condition

- Paid-up is a boundary condition for a reduction in sum assured and this design should be checked for consistency with the paid-up basis.

- A surrender is another boundary condition, and the proposed alteration value is by definition consistent with the surrender value on the existing policy.

- Lapse and re-entry risk

- The premium on the altered policy is by definition less than the premium for a new policy with the same sum assured, which limits the lapse and re-entry risk.

- Small change in benefit

- However, a small reduction in sum assured could possibly lead to a relatively large change in premium rates, depending on how the current premium basis compares to the original premium basis.

- This could lead to a smaller premium on the altered policy (compared to the current premium), for approximately the same sum assured, encouraging alterations.

- There could even be an increase in premium for a reduction in sum assured.

- Frequency of changes

- The basis only changes when new business premium rates change (which should not be very frequent).

- Ease of administrating and communication

- It could be argued that this basis is not excessively complicated to calculate (given that it uses the existing SV).

- However, it may be difficult to explain to policyholders.

- Competition

- Premiums calculated under this basis, should be compared for competitiveness in the market - it the company wishes to be competitive with respect to such alterations. Part (i) was bookwork, and was answered well by the stronger candidates. However, the answers from some candidates were very poor. Answers to part (ii) were generally disappointing, for the following reasons:

- The range of points made was very limited.

- Some candidates just listed the criteria that an alteration basis should meet in general, without explaining how this specific proposal meets / does not meet these criteria.

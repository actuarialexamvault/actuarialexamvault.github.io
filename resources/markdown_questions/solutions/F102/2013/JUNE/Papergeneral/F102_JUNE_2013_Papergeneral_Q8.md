## QUESTION 8

i. Needs met:

- The death benefit can provide a lump sum for:

- Payment of liabilities due on death, e.g. funeral cover, inheritance tax, etc. or repayment of a debt.

- Money for the insured's dependants.

- Can pass on wealth from parents to children in a tax-efficient way.

- Can provide a savings element through the unit fund.

- The presence of surrender values can provide emergency funding prior to death if required, e.g. on a critical illness which is not covered.

- The critical illness benefit can provide policyholders with a lump sum which could:

- Assist in replacing lost income (either during recuperation or after recovery and moving to a less stressful job).

- Facilitate early retirement.

- Meet fixed liabilities, e.g. repaying a mortgage or loan.

- Assist towards meeting medical or other costs related to the illness, e.g. the installation of a lift at home following a stroke, or employing a care-giver.

ii. Risks accepted by policyholders:

- Benefits not received due to:

- insolvency of insurer;

- policyholder may be diagnosed with a critical illness, but the illness may not be one of those specified in the contract (even if it is colloquially regarded as a critical illness);

- there may be exclusion clauses on the contract, e.g. in respect of pre-existing conditions.

- Benefits less valuable than expected due to:

- performance of the assets underlying the units worse than anticipated resulting in lower benefit payments;

- regular risk benefit charges increasing at a rate greater than expected and eroding the unit fund;

- surrender penalty being higher than anticipated causing surrender benefits to be lower than anticipated;

- benefits not properly understood/explained (e.g. assumed they will keep pace with inflation);

- benefits can be eroded due to high inflation or unanticipated increases in costs which the policy was intended to cover;

- not received when expected;

- taxation changes impacting on amounts received.

iii. a. Morbidity (critical illness inception):

- The main risk is that the rate of inception of the critical illnesses covered is underestimated.

- The extent of the risk will depend on the data available, and how applicable it is to the eventual policyholders.

- The company is small and recently-established, and so is unlikely to have sufficient credible data of its own to reliably estimate the inception rate.

- Adverse experience may be due to:

- random fluctuations;

- advances in medical science leading to earlier diagnoses of critical illnesses, etc.

- The risk is essentially related to the timing of the payment of the sum assured (as some payout will ultimately be made regardless).

- The risk is greater than for a death benefit only because payment depends on a potentially subjective diagnosis of a certain critical illness - which may be challenged resulting in unanticipated outgo.

- The risk is lower than on a conventional critical illness policy owing to the presence of a unit fund.

- There is a risk of anti-selection from people suspecting they may carry a high risk of being diagnosed with a critical illness.

- The presence (and length) of an initial waiting period will impact the risk.

- The fact that risk benefit charges may be varied after the first year reduces the risk.

- However, this may lead to:

- policyholder dissatisfaction;

- withdrawals;

- reduced new business;

- the unit fund being exhausted.

- Fluctuating claims levels could be a problem as the company is small and may thus have limited capital.

- Selective withdrawals may exacerbate the morbidity risk.

- Moral hazard could also be a problem if the definition of the critical illnesses covered is not tight. b. Expenses (and expense inflation):

- The only expense charge on the contract is the annual management charge, which must thus meet all initial and renewal expenses.

- The risk is that the annual management charge will not meet the expenses actually incurred.

- The initial expenses and expense charges are mismatched:

- the largest charges occur late in the policy when the unit fund has grown, whereas the highest expenses arise at outset ; and

- non-unit expenses are covered by unit related charges.

- This mismatch can be improved by the use of actuarial funding (which anticipates future unit related margins).

- If investment performance relative to expense inflation is poorer than anticipated renewal expenses may not be recouped.

- Changes in the mix of new business from that anticipated will be a problem as there are likely to be cross-subsidies in the expense recoupment.

- Lower than expected new business volumes is also a risk as fixed expenses may not adequately be recouped.

- The rate of the annual management charge, unlike the risk benefit charge, is not variable and so expense overruns cannot be dealt with by increasing charges.

iv. Capital requirements will be influenced by:

- Contract design (the extent to which it allows reserves and solvency margins to be kept low):

- The unit-linked design should have lower capital requirements, e.g. through the use of actuarial funding to reduce unit reserves.

- The lower guarantee on the unit-linked policy (from the variable benefit charges) should also help reduce the capital requirements.

- Frequency of premium payment (getting premiums in earlier will reduce capital requirements):

- The without-profits policy would have lower capital requirements, as all of the first year's premium is received at outset.

- Relationship between premium and supervisory reserving bases (the stronger the supervisory basis relative to the pricing basis the greater the capital requirements).

- This may differ by type of product and will depend on the regulatory regime.

- The level of initial expenses (higher initial expenses imply higher capital requirements):

- The initial expenses under the two contracts may be similar.

Part (iv) was a fairly straightforward application of bookwork. Many candidates did poorly in this question, illustrating that they did not know the bookwork, or gave poor explanations of the factors demonstrating that they did not understand their relevance.

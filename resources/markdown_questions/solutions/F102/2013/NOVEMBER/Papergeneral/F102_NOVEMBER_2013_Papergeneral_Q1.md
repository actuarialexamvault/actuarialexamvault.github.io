## QUESTION 1

- Investigate whether the actual per policy expenses are higher than those expected in the valuation basis.

- It would have been expected that per policy expenses would have increased over the two valuation periods, due to expense inflation and the reducing number of policies in the closed book (all else being equal).

- If per policy expenses were as expected then not too much time should be spent on further investigation.

- If, however, the increase was not expected, then further investigation should be carried out in order to take corrective action where necessary.

- Investigate whether any mistakes were made in the initial analysis.

- Investigations will consider only renewal expenses because the book is closed for new business and hence would have no initial expenses.

- Consider the functional expense analysis to determine whether significantly more expenses were allocated to the book than previously. If so, investigate why.

- If it was due to a once-off item, like a new IT system needed to administer the book, no action should be taken and the expense basis should not be adjusted for it.

- If this was due to recurring expenses that have simply increased, for example due to more expensive staff being required to administer the book, then the expense basis should be adjusted accordingly.

- Investigate whether withdrawal experience has affected per policy expenses, by comparing the level of withdrawals experienced with that expected per the valuation basis.

- If these are significantly higher, then an investigation into the underlying reasons may be launched to take corrective action if necessary.

- Ways of reducing the expense base should be looked into and recommended to management.

## QUESTION 2

(i)
Claims definitions Inability to perform 3/4 or more activities of daily living on standard ADL scale (or some other independent measure of incapacity) and moving into frail care accommodation.
There should be an exclusion for residing in frail care for recuperating after an operation and a deferred period e.g. three months to ensure that incapacity is permanent.
The ADL criteria need to be carefully determined so that the policyholder will meet the criteria when genuinely needing frail care.
The claims definition needs to be clear, otherwise there is a risk of disputes if policyholders have different expectations.
(ii)
Advantages and disadvantages of Option A over Option B: Monetary benefit as opposed to indemnity benefit lessens the guarantee offered by the insurer therefore lower cost compared to option B.
The benefit may (unexpectedly) turn out to provide a benefit greater than is required to cover the additional costs of Frail Care, allowing the policyholder to cover any additional costs which might be needed. (This may, however, be considered a disadvantage if it means that the policyholder is paying for a benefit they don't need.) Advantages and Disadvantage of Option B over Option A: Indemnity benefit covers the actual cost of care which avoids the issue of dissatisfaction of policyholders if annuity payments do not meet cost of care.
But subject to maximum payment level so not protected against increases in cost of frail care by more than the cut off level.

(iii)
Volume and mix of new business Volume of new business depends on the take-up of policies from existing members of the retirement community group and on how quickly the group opens up new facilities.
If take-up and future growth is too low business volumes may not justify the initial costs and employment of experts to manage this specialised business.
If business grows too quickly new business strain may adversely affect the solvency position of the insurer (there are significant guarantees in this product design and the uncertainty relating to future benefit payments means that there are likely to be high margins in the reserving and capital requirements for this business).
Changes in types of facilities that are opened in the future may result in a change in new business mix by target market and size of contract. This may affect the risk profile, capital needs and adequacy of allowance for expenses in the premiums.
Actions of distributers Distributors may take actions that are in their own interests rather than in policyholders (suggest more expensive product to earn higher commission) or business lapsing/ moving to cheaper policies.
There is a risk that the terms and conditions are not well explained resulting in dissatisfied policyholders.
Competition The insurer needs to compete initially to win the business of the retirement community group. The insurer may need to compete initially on price and service.
There is no competition from other players once the agreement between the parties is in place.
If the retirement community decides to change insurer underwriting the product the risks would need to be transferred to the new insurer.
Economic Environment The economic environment may affect the affordability of premiums for this product.
Single premium: Lower investment returns before retirement are likely to result in smaller than expected lump sum at retirement.
Regular premium: Lower investment returns after retirement are likely to influence whether policyholders can afford regular premiums.
In a poor economic environment policyholders may select the cheaper option or lapse their policies.
Legal, regulatory and fiscal developments Changes in state support for the elderly may affect demand for the product.

Change in regulation is a risk to the insurers. Since care of the aged is a politically sensitive issue there is a risk of state interference and the insurer having to provide a minimum level of benefits that were not originally priced for.
If there is a preferential tax regime for retirement savings products and insurance post-retirement changes in the pre- and post-retirement tax regime could affect propensity to make additional savings for retirement or purchase insurance after retirement.

Expenses Unexpected increases in expenses due to unforeseen expenses and expense inflation.
This is particularly an issue because the premium rates are guaranteed.
Examiner's comment This question was poorly answered. Many candidates failed to demonstrate an understanding of the issues relating to long-term care insurance.
(i)Many candidates failed to consider the wider issues around claim definition like the need for
exclusions for recuperation thus failing to demonstrate a full understanding of the notes. A number of candidates did not consider the 'considerations when determining definition' and therefore failed to fully answer the question.
(ii) Weaker candidates failed consider advantages and disadvantages beyond the benefit definition.
Few candidates considered technical aspects like the effect of guarantees on costs.
(iii) Although many candidates managed to generate a large number of points for this part. Many of
the points were vague and did not link to the structure of the product or the retirement community aspect.
At the F102 level examiners expect candidate to be able to justify why a particular issue is important.
Comments like "select an appropriate distribution channel" were not given full credit. But many candidates discussed general issues relating to product design like "return on capital" when the question required candidates to discuss general business environment issues. This was an 8 mark question and some candidates did not generate sufficient points for mark allocation.

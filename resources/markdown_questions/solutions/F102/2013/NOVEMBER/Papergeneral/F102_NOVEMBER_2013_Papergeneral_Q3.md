## QUESTION 3

(i)
Benefits Quota share with a low retention limit would have reduced the capital required by the insurer easing any solvency pressures and the volatility and uncertainty of its future results.
The insurer may have needed technical assistance from the reinsurer e.g. setting premium rates and underwriting.
Reinsurance rates may have been favourable allowing the insurer to make a guaranteed profit on reinsurance by charging a risk rate higher than the reinsurance rate.
(ii)
Key disadvantages: The reinsurer might make specific demands regarding risk management (e.g. referrals) that impact on the business processes, i.e. the level of freedom of the business might decline.
If the business is profitable you are giving away profit to the reinsurer.
(iii)
Individual surplus reinsurance The excess (if any) of the sum at risk or sum assured above the insurer's retention limit on any individual life is reinsured.
This allows the insurer to fully retain lower sum at risk amounts, but to reinsure larger sum at risk amounts that are likely to have an impact on the financial results of the insurer.
Aggregate excess of loss The aggregate losses over a specified retention level are reinsured.
E.g. catastrophe cover where a catastrophe could be defined as a minimum number of deaths from a single incident with the deaths occurring within a specified time of that incident.
E.g. stop loss reinsurance where the reinsurer pays the aggregate net loss over the predetermined retention for a portfolio over a given time period, usually a year. But not likely to be available at a reasonable cost to insurer.
Facultative reinsurance will be used for unusual risks outside the surplus treaty.
Factors influencing the reinsurance programme Availability of certain types of cover (e.g. stop loss cover may not be available in the market).
Cost of reinsurance relative to cost of holding additional capital (or other risk mitigation mechanisms).
Terms offered and restrictions places on business by reinsurers.

The risk appetite and solvency position of the insurer will influence the retention level set by the insurer.
Capacity and financial position of reinsurers will influence the amount of risk that reinsurers are willing to accept.
Credit rating of the reinsurer will influence the default risk of reinsurers and hence the reinsurers selected for cover.
Examiner's comment This question was fairly straightforward, but was not well answered. Many candidates missed the easy bookwork points. There was some confusion amongst candidates what is meant by the 'type' of reinsurance, with candidates giving points on risk premium vs quota share, treaty vs facultative and original terms, which were not given credit. A few candidates got stuck in detail about administration and softer issues such as relationship building. These points did not get marks and wasted valuable time.

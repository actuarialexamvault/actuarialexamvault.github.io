## QUESTION 4

(i)
Actuarial funding

- Actuarial funding is a process that allows the insurer to recognise charges in excess of those needed for recurring expenses at point of sale.

- It assists by reducing the total reserves held by the company at point of sale, and hence reduces new business strain.

- In addition, it eliminates investment risk because of the mismatch between initial expenses (generally a monetary amount) and charges (% of fund over time).

- Actuarial funding should be allowed by regulation. Conditions

- The policy should offer a death benefit or a benefit on survival to a particular date.

- The policy will need to have a (unit-related) surrender penalty to ensure that at any stage the surrender value is below the actuarially funded value.

- The fund management charges will need to be in excess of the recurring expenses attributed to the policy. (After actuarial funding, prudently projected future profit flows remain positive.)

(ii)
Financing Requirement

- Given the unit linked structure the capital required for setting up reserves may be lower than with-out profit business.

- In addition, if actuarial funding is used as for the other portfolios, the initial strain on the product will be reduced.

- However, large levels of new business would likely still result in material new business strain for the company.

- In order to start up the fund, initial capital will be required. In particular due to the nature of the assets i.e. direct holding in large assets, a significant shareholder investment will likely be required for the initial capital. This funding will need to be returned to the shareholder grown at the cost of capital as the portfolio grows.

Risk Characteristics

- The nature of the assets creates a liquidity risk. If a large number of policyholders leave the portfolio, the asset manager may not be able to liquidate the assets at market price to meet the cash flow requirements.

- It may be necessary to implement high surrender charges on the portfolio as a disincentive to withdraw.

- The liquidity may result in a need to keep a sufficient proportion of the portfolio in cash. This may result in sub-optimal returns. This may result in increased lapse and expense risk.

- The portfolio will be subject to lapse risk due to the high initial expenses which are only recouped over the period of the contract. This will be mitigated by the level of the surrender charge.

- The portfolio will have expense risk if volumes are too low to meet overheads or if there are expense overruns. Profitability

- The product should meet the profitability requirements of the company. This will be determined by the charges on the unit-linked product.

- The charges should be sufficient to at least cover the initial and recurring expenses as well as the costs of designing and setting up the portfolio. Sensitivity of Profit

(iii)

- This will be done at the appropriation price

- The market value of the assets would need to be obtained

- As the assets are direct property, there is unlikely to be an observable market value.

- A mark to model approach or use of a property valuation company will be necessary

- A mark to model approach could model the expected cashflows of the property using a financial economic approach where unknown parameters are set so as to be consistent with market values where a corresponding market exists

- Any expenses involved in purchasing additional assets will need to be added

- Any current assets would need to be added

- Any current liabilities will need to be subtracted

- The price will need to be increased for any accrued income

- Less allowance for accrued tax

- This would be divided by the number of units to get the price Examiner's comment This question was not answered well overall by the candidates.

(i)This part was bookwork yet few candidates scored full marks for the question. It was clear that
many candidates did not understand how actuarial funding is applied to unitised business.
(ii) This part was very poorly answered. Few candidates identified that the policyholder would carry
the investment risk. Many assumed that the insurance company would carry the direct investment risk and expenses of the property rather than the risk of the impact of markets on the charges applied to the portfolio.
(iii) This part was bookwork yet few candidates managed to score full marks. Very few candidates
identified that a new portfolio would be priced using the appropriation price.

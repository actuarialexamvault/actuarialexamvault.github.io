## QUESTION 5

(i)
Full medical underwriting is unlikely to be cost-effective for the simple lower sum assured product and may act as a barrier to sales.
Alternatives to full medical underwriting include:

- Using a waiting period (e.g. three months) where only claims relating to accidents will be covered

- Using a questionnaire (or simplified questionnaire) covering medical, lifestyle and financial questions to allow for lifestyle, financial and limited medical underwriting The underwriting decision is likely to either "accept at standard rates" or "decline". But if a more complicated approach is taken the insurer may use the results from the medical questionnaire to flag applicants for further medical tests, loaded premium rates or exclusions. Claims underwriting may need to be performed to enforce the exclusions. Insurer may consider and HIV test only.

(ii)
General comments

- The company has been selling a whole life product for many years hence it will have experience for all the relevant assumptions.

- However, the product is different and one would need to consider carefully the extent to which assumptions can be used for the new product.

- The current experience should at least be used to give boundaries, either minimum or maximum, to your new assumptions. Mortality:

- The mortality rates for the new product is likely to be higher than the existing product due to:

 - Differences in target market the lower socio economic class (based on lower sums insured)

 - Less extensive underwriting

- Simpler underwriting decision ("accept" or "decline") could mean that lives that would have been loaded on the existing product may be accepted at standard rates, so the mortality assumption for standard rates cases needs to be relatively higher

- There is an overlap in the sums insured of the two products so the experience of the lower sums insured will be more relevant

 - e.g. male / female, smoker / non-smoker, standard rates / loaded,

- The data will need to be aggregated for the new products if fewer rating factors are used

- There may be industry data for this type of product, or the company could get assistance from reinsurers or consultants with setting the assumptions

- Trends in mortality, levels of underwriting etc. must be taken into account in making adjustments to insurer's data and other sources of data Expenses and commission

- Load what you are going to pay for commission.

- Expenses are likely to be lower than for the existing product as:

 - there is less underwriting; and

 - the product is simpler.

- Base the assumption on the existing experience, but only allowing for the relevant items.

- Make some common sense adjustments to the existing experience.

- Per policy expenses for costs that do not vary with the size of the contract need to be carefully considered as sum assured are lower than existing product...

- Policy fees need to be set at a reasonable level compared to the premium to ensure the product remains competitive

- Allowance needs to be made if there will be any cross-subsidies between the different products Lapses:

- The lapse experience is likely to be higher than the existing product existing product, due to:

 - the socio economic class of the policyholder.

 - But could be lower due to the fact that no surrender value is offered (depending whether SV is offered on old product)

 - Potential for lapse and re-entering should be considered Investment:

- The existing product can be used as a base.

- But it will also depend on what assets will be invested in.

Profit margin and other considerations:

- You would rely on the profit margin that your company / shareholders require

- The profit loading should be higher than for the existing product ...

- ...as the new product is more risky as you don't have any experience

- You would need to consider reasonable margins for uncertainty The following other assumptions also scored marks, but only to a limited extent

- Tax rates, which should be the same as the current product's

- Cost of reinsurance

- Likely to require an assumption on the volume and mix of new business, especially for the expense assumption...

- Sensitivity tests and scenario analysis may be performed to test certain assumptions and how big the impact is of under/over estimating them. Examiner's comment:

(i) This part was well answered. Good candidates commented on the likely outcomes of such a limited
underwriting process (accept/decline only), although other outcomes were also given credit
(ii) A key issue which candidates needed to identify is that the company would have a large amount
mortality (and other) data but that the new product is very different. Since mortality is the key assumption most marks were allocated to that assumption. It was disappointing that many candidates elaborated in detail as to why the assumption is required or important, rather than how to set the assumption and how that is affected by the scenario given.

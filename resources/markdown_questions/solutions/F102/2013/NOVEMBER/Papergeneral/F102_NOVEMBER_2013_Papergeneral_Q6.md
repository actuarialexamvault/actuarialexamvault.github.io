## QUESTION 6

(i)
Past profit distributions

- Past profit distributed as a paid-up addition to the sum assured under the contract is a guaranteed liability, and a prudent value of this liability must be included in the valuation of all existing policies. Future profit distributions

- A supervisory valuation should allow for future bonuses on conventional with-profits contracts to the extent that some level of future bonuses is thought to be consistent with policyholders' reasonable expectations.

- These bonuses would include regular reversionary bonuses and may not include terminal bonuses.

- Future surpluses should be projected to emerge in a suitable pattern and amount so as to match the assumed future regular bonus.

- Where no explicit allowance is made for future distributions, a suitable reduction should be made to the valuation rate of interest, if necessary. The valuation interest rate and statistical basis should be prudent (include margins for adverse experience). Consistency between valuation assumptions is important. The method of calculation of the reserves from year to year should be such as to recognise profit in an appropriate way over the duration of each policy and should not be subject to discontinuities arising from arbitrary changes to the valuation basis.

(ii)

- Should consider what the previous company's philosophy has been with regards to the split

- Since PRE would have been formed, and a similar philosophy would be expected

- However, since it is a closed book of business, a change could be warranted because you would need to distribute any surplus equitably over all remaining policies.

- Should consider the term profile of the book of business, because the longer the average term to maturity, the more policyholders would require RB for peace of mind

- Consider the funding level of the portfolio - the higher the funding level, the higher the TB could be

- Equities have volatile returns, so the company would want to keep policy guarantees low to protect solvency, hence prefer TB to RB

- RBs increase guarantees so increase risk of insolvency

- Will also depend on volume of business remaining in closed book

- And on particular assets invested in - and if the company intends to change the split between equities vs fixed interest whilst this book is running down

- Low free assets of the company increases risk, so increases preference for TB

- Reserves for RB would need big margins if it's backed by equities, which would reduce free assets further

- TBs defer surplus distribution, reducing build-up of guarantees and therefore increasing free assets

- The split should still reflect company's marketing literature

- Will not wish to deviate too far from competitors' practice

- It also depends on the bonus earning capacity of the book - large BEC, large TBs

- Shareholders would prefer RBs due to earlier payments to them Examiner's comment Candidates answered this question reasonably well, given that a large part could be seen as bookwork.

(i) Few candidates referred to general aspects of supervisory valuation eg prudence and consistency.
(ii) Few candidates generated enough ideas to score full marks.

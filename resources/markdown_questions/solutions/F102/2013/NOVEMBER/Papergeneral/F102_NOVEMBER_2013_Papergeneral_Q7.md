## QUESTION 7

(i)

- The insurer will have to cover the shortfall if the bid value of the fund is below the total premiums paid at maturity.

- A stochastic model of unit growth is needed where investment returns on asset classes in any given period are modeled as the outcomes of random variables with specified probability distributions.

- Suitable parameters would also have to be chosen, such as the mean and variance of returns on the assets and the relationships between asset returns.

- The model would be run using simulations.

- This could produce several thousand possible values for the unit fund at maturity.

- Some of these simulations will result in the bid value of the units falling below the total premiums paid at maturity and shortfall for the insurer (cost of the guarantee).

- An estimate of the expected value of the cost of the guarantee would then be an average of all the simulated outcomes.

- The results will only be valid if the model and the chosen parameters are appropriate.

(ii)
Affordability & Profit Contribution:

- In general, the penalty is required to recover the cost of initial expenses (not recovered yet at the date of alteration) and the cost of alterations.

- The penalty does not reduce over the term of the contract. It is a flat 10% linked to the bidvalue of the units. Since this is a regular premium product the bid value of the units will be significantly lower at early durations which means that there is a cross-subsidy between alterations early on in the contract and alterations later on in the contract.

- The company is exposed to the risk of high lapse rates at early durations.

- It is not clear whether a penalty relating to the bid value of the units would allow for the cost of alterations. Fairness:

- Policyholders may not view the above cross-subsidy as fair. Consistency with:

 - Surrender values early on depends on investment performance which may be volatile given investment funds. In addition there is a surrender penalty. Surrender values may therefore be significantly lower than premiums paid.

 - This is inconsistent with PRE.

- Maturity values:

 - There is a relatively large discrepancy (10%) between maturity values and the value available on surrender just before maturity i.e. the surrender value close to maturity will be significantly lower than the maturity value.

 - This will appear inconsistent to policyholders.

 - A premium reduction shortly before maturity would also result in a relatively large penalty.

- Internal consistency:

 - Boundary conditions: the values available on a significant disinvestment and surrender are consistent.

 - There is a material difference between the values a policyholder will receive if he/she surrenders, versus making the product paid-up and the shortly thereafter affects a full disinvestment. The penalties are easy to

- Administer.

- Explain to policyholders and document. In addition, the penalties should:

- be competitive relative to those on other products in the market.

- comply with any regulatory requirements. Examiner's comment The quality of the attempt made on this question was disappointing. A number of candidates failed to attempt part (ii)

(i) This was a straight forward application question and many candidates made a reasonable attempt.
Candidates mainly lost marks through not discussing the technical aspects in more detail. Some points made indicated that candidates did not understand the cashflow processes for unit-linked products.
(ii) This part was poorly answered. Candidates failed to take a systematic approach in considering
the reasonability of the penalties structures based on the principles of determining alteration conditions in the notes. This resulted in candidates discussing certain aspects like consistency with maturity values in detail and failing to consider other aspects. To score well in a question candidate needed to cover all the principles of alterations. Points that related to both alteration structures were not given credit twice. Many candidates wasted time through repeating points. Many candidates failed to discuss the general principles like competitors approach which are easy marks in a more challenging question.

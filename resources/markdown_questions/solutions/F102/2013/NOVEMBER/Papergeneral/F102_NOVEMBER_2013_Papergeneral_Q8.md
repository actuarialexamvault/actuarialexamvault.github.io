## QUESTION 8

(i)
There could be many reasons for holding shareholder equity in excess of the minimum solvency margin:

- Maintain a probability of ruin that is acceptable to the company's shareholders

- Maintain an acceptable level of solvency relative to other insurers in the market

- Maintain a pre-determined credit rating which affects the cost of capital funding and reputation among policyholders and brokers

- Fund future new business plans

- Fund large expenditures expected in future, e.g. costs associated with a new administration system

- Allow more investment freedom, which could include deliberate asset liability mismatching with the aim of obtaining higher returns on more risky assets

- Allow management greater freedom to pursue potentially profitable projects

- Maintain funds for potential business opportunities, e.g. acquisition of smaller companies

- Allow the company to reinsure a smaller proportion of its risks and thus retain a larger amount of the profits

- Build up shareholder excess in anticipation of more onerous regulatory reporting requirements Potential reasons for paying out less than the maximum dividend:

- By paying out the maximum dividend based on the minimum solvency margin the company will no longer meet its internal solvency margin and this might be unacceptable to the company

- Even though the company would remain solvent on a regulatory basis after paying the maximum dividend it will be rendered very close to insolvency, which would already trigger the regulator to take action against the company

- If the maximum dividend is paid then the company could be rendered insolvent from even a small adverse deviation in experience this is quite likely given the random variation that the company is exposed to on investment, mortality, expense and other experience

(ii)
Maximum dividend calculations: Internal solvency margin = 1.5 * Minimum solvency margin = 1.5 * R120m = R180m Maximum dividend = Shareholder equity - Internal solvency margin = R230m - R180m = R50m

(iii)
Mismatching risk Interest rates

- When interest rates increase the company's assets decreased by less than its liabilities, which results in a profit emerging

- This means that the company is probably exposed to losses from interest rate reductions, in which case assets would increase by less than the liabilities and a loss would emerge

- This is most likely due to the terms of the assets being too short relative to the term of the liabilities Foreign exchange rates

- Some of the company's liabilities are denominated in a foreign currency, whereas all the assets are denominated in the domestic currency

- As shown in the sensitivity test this exposes the company to losses if the domestic currency depreciates

(iv)
Liabilities are not always known with certainty e.g. they often depend on mortality and it is difficult to find mortality-linked assets.
If assets are chosen to match the longest of the liability payments, the earlier income from the assets may exceed the shorter-term liability outgo. This exposes the insurer to reinvestment risk The term of the longest available assets may be too short for the liabilities.
Assets that fully match increasing in benefits may not be available e.g. salary index-linked for income protection benefits.
There is also uncertainty around future cash inflows (e.g. premiums) and on what future terms they can be invested.

(v)
The company can take the following actions to reduce its mismatching risk on foreign exchange rates.
Invest an appropriate amount of assets in the relevant foreign currencies to match the liabilities by currency.
However, it is important to make sure that these assets also match the liabilities by term and nature.
Given the long dated nature of the liabilities, as indicated by the previous question, it might be that the foreign market doesn't have sufficiently long term assets to match the liabilities, in which case the company would have to decide whether to accept the exchange rate risk that it is exposed to currently or the interest rate risk which it would be exposed to if it follows this proposal.
Alternatively the company could use exchange rate derivatives to obtain the appropriate exposure to foreign currencies Derivatives might allow the company to be protected from downside risk while at the same time retaining upside risk. For example an option that pays out when the domestic currency depreciates would provide such protection.
If any changes are made to the assets the following general requirements for investments should be taken into account.

- Costs associated with making the changes

- Regulatory restrictions on asset holdings or the use of derivatives

- The extent to which the company actually wants to avoid the mismatching risk

- Consistency with current investment mandates

- Whether the company has any expertise on assets in the foreign market or on exchange rate derivatives

- Instead of changing its asset profile the company could also try to change it liability profile For example it could focus new business sales on products for which reserves are denominated in the domestic currency. This will only result in a gradual change over time, especially if the book is large, and might thus be ineffective. Such action might also be inconsistent with the company's new business strategy. Examiner comments This question was poorly answered and there were some indications that candidates were under time pressure.

(i) This question required candidates to generate a large number of ideas, with most candidates not

such any comments about deferring profits and associated tax benefits did not score marks. There might be tax advantages from the deferral of dividends, but this had to be stated clearly to score marks. Some candidates mentioned with-profits business and bonuses, whereas the question clearly stated that the company had only without-profits business.
(ii) This was a simple calculation question that was well answered by a large number of candidates.
Some candidates calculated a dividend based on the minimum solvency margin instead of the internal solvency margin, whereas other candidates didn't understand the relationship between the free assets and the solvency margin.
(iii) This question tested candidates' understanding of asset-liability matching and was generally
poorly answered. Most candidates stated that the company is well matched in terms of interest rates, since it made a profit under the interest rate increase scenario, but this is not the case. Assets and liabilities move in the same direction when the interest rates increase, indicating some level of matching, but this does not mean the assets and liabilities are matched well. Only a handful of candidates realised this and mentioned that the company is actually mismatched and that it is probably exposed to losses if interest rates were to decrease. It was clear that some candidates did not understand asset-liability matching, as their solutions didn't consider assets and liabilities in relation to each other, but rather considered them in isolation. Some candidates did not read the question properly and only commented on foreign exchange rate risk, not interest rate risk.
(iv) This was a bookwork question that was poorly answered, with only a few candidates mentioning
that the standard bookwork points. Some candidates incorrectly stated that matching would remove all profits, whereas in reality it would only remove mismatching profits. Many candidates mentioned that shareholders might require higher yielding assets and hence mismatching is not possible. While this is a constraint in practice it is possible for a company to change its view in this regard and no marks were awarded for these comments.
(v)This question again required candidates to generate ideas as to how foreign exchange risk can be
reduced. Candidates did not score marks for saying that free assets can be used to absorb losses, as this does not actually reduce the mismatching risk that is present. Many candidates mentioned that the risk can be transferred via reinsurance, but this would require the reinsurer to accept the foreign exchange rate risk, as opposed to just insurance risk, which tends to be unlikely. This had to be explained to score marks.

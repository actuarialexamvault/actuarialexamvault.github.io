## QUESTION 1

i. Asset-enhancing financial reinsurance can help since:

- It may be used to unlock a proportion of the value of the "profitable" in-force business or discounted cashflow on policies.

- The value of in-force (VIF) is the excess of the statutory reserves over the realistic reserves in a portfolio.

- VIF will be released over time, but is currently an off-balance sheet, non-tangible asset.

- In exchange for entering into a reinsurance contract on existing business, typically an original terms quota share, the reinsurer gives the insurer cash now.

- This is paid back over the next few years from the future emergence of the VIF as future profits. This may be preferable to a loan since:

- The cash received from the reinsurer increases the assets of the insurer's balance sheet.

- However, there is no change in the liabilities since the financing reinsurance takes the form of a contingent loan that was provided by the reinsurer.

- The loan is contingent since the repayment of the loan is dependent on the future profits arising (VIF and the block of business on which the loan has been secured will be specified).

- A regular loan would create an additional liability on the balance sheet that may not be desirable for the company.

- Regulations may prohibit insurers from taking out a loan.

ii. Reasons:

- A proportional arrangement may be a requirement from the reinsurer to provide technical support.

- Technical support is likely to be required given that the company is new to CI products, may be exploring new, unfamiliar target markets and/or sales channels.

- Technical support may include:

- Product development, data and pricing.

- Underwriting guidelines and/or manuals, assessing sub-standard or very large cases.

- Assistance with claims assessing.

- Training of staff.

- Monitoring of the emerging experience.

- The proportional reinsurance arrangement will also help with:

- Reducing new business strain as capital may be scarce during the expansion.

- Reducing claims volatility which might be desirable given that the book will take time to grow.

iii. The key interested parties:

- Shareholders - stability and protection of profits and continued existence of company, access to expertise of the reinsurer to keep the company up to date with trends.

- Clients - ability of their insurer to meet claims, even under difficult claim/ economic circumstances.

- Regulator - compliance to any regulations relating to reinsurance, capital adequacy affected by security of reinsurer. Other interested parties include:

- Credit rating agencies - to assess the credit worthiness, and hence rate, the insurer.

- Intermediaries - to assess the stability of the insurer and its ability to pay claims.

- Auditors - to audit the reinsurance arrangements, including premiums paid and recoveries made. This was a fairly straightforward question handled reasonably well by most candidates. In part (i) some candidates did not answer both parts of the question, i.e. how asset-enhancing reinsurance can be used, and why it may be preferable to a loan. In part (ii) the answers of several candidates were overly generic, giving general reasons for reinsuring and not focusing on the specific question. Some candidates, unnecessarily, explained what proportional reinsurance is. Part (iii) was very straightforward, with many candidates scoring full marks.

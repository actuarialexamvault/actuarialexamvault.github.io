## QUESTION 2

i. Medical conditions:

- Cancer

- Heart attack

- Stroke

- Coronary artery bypass graft (bypass surgery)

ii. Difficulties in pricing:

- Data:

- The company is unlikely to have sufficient internal data with which to price the conditions that it has not priced in the past.

- External data such as industry investigations, international research or reinsurer data may not be available.

- Tiered benefit:

- To tier the benefits the company first needs definitions for the different severity levels for each of the conditions covered.

- The company would also need incidence rates that correspond to those definitions.

- Determining appropriate payout percentages for different severity levels would also be difficult, and would require significant medical expertise.

- The company may also need to adopt a multistage modelling approach to allow for disease progression (for example a low severity cancer claim may later become more severe).

- It is unlikely that offering tiered benefits on anything other than the four core benefits would be viable, and even on those the company would have difficulty coming up with accurate rates.

- Medical advances:

- The uncertainty about both current rates and future changes in experience due to medical advances makes it difficult for the company to price the 10 year guarantee.

- Medical advances (which are very difficult to predict) may lead to earlier detection of claims (hence more frequent low severity claims).

- Medical advances may also prevent more serious conditions from occurring.

- Accelerator benefits:

- If the benefit is offered as an accelerator on life cover it would be necessary to calculate survival factors (e.g. for 30 days after the occurrence of the claim event), since death within the survival period as a result of a critical illness would result in a death payment.

- This factor would then be used to determine an "overlap discount" which the company would need to apply either to the mortality or to the critical illness rates.

- The company is likely to have very limited data with which to determine such survival factors. Difficulties in administering:

- Underwriting:

- The company would need underwriting and claims guidelines for all 40 illnesses, for each severity tier, which would be difficult to produce.

- This would introduce significant complexity into the day to day work of assessors.

- Qualified staff:

- Highly qualified claims and underwriting staff who have been very thoroughly trained on the product would be needed.

- Reinsurance:

- The company may have to rely heavily on a partner reinsurer, which could require reinsuring a significant portion of the business.

- IT:

- A medium-sized company may not have a sufficient IT workforce of its own and may require external consultants for this type of work.

- Claim disputes:

- At claims stage the company may be exposed to disputes.

- E.g. when a policyholder suffers from a disease that is not technically on the list of 40, but is similar.

- Policyholders may expect that the policy would cover any critical illness.

- This exposes the company to legal action and the potential for bad publicity.

- Distribution:

- The complexity of the product means that it is best suited for sale via independent intermediaries.

- Rate guarantees:

- Even if experience is very bad, as a result of the expectations of the policyholders the company may in practice be unable to increase rates at the end of the 10 year guarantee period.

- Even if it is able to increase rates there is a good chance that healthy lives would simply choose to lapse their policies, leaving the company with only the bad risks (selective withdrawals).

- This uncertainty makes it difficult to appropriately allow for the reviewability of premiums after 10 years.

- Lapse and re-entry:

- Depending on the success of the product it may cause significant churn, where policyholders with the existing core product may wish to upgrade to the comprehensive product.

## QUESTION 3

i. Mortality:

- The risk is that the office underestimates mortality (when the unit fund is below the guaranteed death benefit). If so the mortality charges will prove inadequate.

- As the product may attract a different target market the company's experience may be of limited value.

- There may be a need to source appropriate assumptions elsewhere, e.g. from a reinsurer.

- The extent of the risk will depend on how applicable the existing data are.

- AIDS will be a major concern, even though the target market may be less exposed to HIV/AIDS than the population in general.

- Since no HIV testing is done a high incidence of AIDS deaths could result.

- Anti-selection may be a problem since there are no medical tests.

- Selling through independent intermediaries will exacerbate the problem of antiselection.

- However, mortality selection may not be too severe as it is tied to the purchase of a house and the ability to convince a bank to issue a mortgage.

- Moral hazard (fraud) may be a concern since declarations of health are easy to lie on.

- Selective withdrawals are also a risk.

- The ability of the office to revise its mortality charges at any time reduces the mortality risk.

- Charges though can only be varied to the extent permitted by legislation, competition and PRE.

- If mortality experience is favourable, the office may come under pressure to reduce mortality charges (and premiums at review). Expenses and Inflation:

- The risk is that the expense charges (the 10% unallocated premiums) are too low to cover the expenses.

- There is a mismatch in timing between initial expenses and charges.

- The level of expenses will be uncertain because the office is entering a new market with a new product.

- E.g. admin. costs, development costs, marketing campaign costs.

- The costs of implementing premium reviews may not be known up front.

- Changes in the mix of business (e.g. by policy size) from that anticipated is also a problem as there are likely to be cross-subsidies involved in the expense recoupment.

- Lower than expected new business volumes is also a risk as fixed expenses may not be adequately recouped.

- Higher than expected new business volumes may be a risk as it may cause capital strain and put pressure on administration systems, etc.

- The fact that charges (through the unallocated premium) are not variable exacerbates the situation.

- However, since premiums can be reviewed after 5 years there is the possibility of obtaining higher expense charges at that time. Withdrawals:

- The greatest risk of loss is associated with more early withdrawals than expected when asset shares are low/negative.

- Withdrawals at later times should be able to be dealt with by imposing an appropriate surrender penalty.

- The company has no relevant experience of withdrawal rates with this type of product.

- However, because the product is linked to house purchases through mortgages withdrawals are likely to be quite low Marketing/Legal:

- If investment returns are poor and maturity values are lower than expected, it is possible that payouts will not cover the policyholder's mortgage.

- This could lead to a reputational risk through bad publicity, accusations of misselling associated with the quality of advice given, etc.

- If the premium review procedure is not explained well to policyholders and intermediaries (in marketing literature and policy documentation) there could be significant problems if there is a need to implement a review. New Business volumes:

- New business volumes are likely to be very unpredictable as this is an entirely new product in the market.

- It may be difficult to develop this new market, as the consumers and intermediaries are not used to unit-linked business. Other risks:

- The fact that benefit charges and premiums are reviewable may encourage the office to make unrealistically optimistic pricing and reserving assumptions.

- Future regulatory changes relating to this new product may be a risk, e.g. requiring guaranteed surrender/maturity values.

ii. Negative non-unit reserves:

- A negative non-unit reserve can be held for a policy under which future charges are expected to be more than sufficient to meet future non-unit liabilities (including expenses).

- The reserve represents a loan from other contracts which have positive non-unit reserves.

- The loan will be repaid by the emerging future profits from the policy for which the negative non-unit reserve is held. Constraints:

- Negative non-unit reserves need to be permissible under local legislation.

- The sum of the unit and non-unit reserve for a policy should not be less than any guaranteed surrender value.

- There should be adequate non-unit surrender penalties to ensure that the value of the future cashflows is not lost on a surrender.

- The future profits arising on the policy with the negative non-unit reserve need to emerge in time to repay the "loan".

- After taking account of the future non-unit reserves, there should be no future negative cashflows for the policy (i.e. no future valuation strain).

- In aggregate, the sum of all non-unit reserves (from all business, not just unitlinked policies) should not be negative.

- The negative non-unit reserves should be determined prudently, i.e.:

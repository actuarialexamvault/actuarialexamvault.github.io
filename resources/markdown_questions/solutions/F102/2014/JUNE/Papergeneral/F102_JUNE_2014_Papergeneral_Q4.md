## QUESTION 4

i. a. Retrospective earned asset share/normal premium rates:

- The proposal is over-generous to the policyholder.

- By giving the earned asset share, the insurer will be retaining none of the profit (or loss) on the policy to date.

- By then applying this amount on normal premium rates the insurer will only make the amount of profit loaded for in the new policy.

- This amount of profit is unlikely to be appropriate for the company since the new policy is much smaller than the original one.

- However, the company uses the normal single premium basis which will include an allowance for initial expenses, leading to double counting of initial expenses. This offsets the "loss" of profit to some extent.

- Given that the asset share is used in the alteration and assuming that that asset share is positive at this duration, the alteration should be affordable.

- The insurer will need to make sure that the asset share less the deduction for alteration expenses is not less than zero, as this would result in an altered benefit which is lower than the equivalent new business benefit for the altered policy, exposing the company to a lapse-and-re-entry risk on the altered policy. This is not likely, however, so far into the policy. b. Equate realistic policy values:

- This alteration should be affordable, provided that the asset share exceeds the realistic reserve on the original policy given that the benefits of the altered policy are valued on a realistic basis.

- Using a realistic value means that the company will retain the full expected profit (over the full term) for the original policy.

- Using a realistic basis for the altered policy makes no allowance for profit that is expected to emerge over the remaining term of the contract, and hence the company will not expect to make any further profit on the altered policy.

- This method may thus not be suitable since the size of the policy is being substantially reduced, and so it may not be fair to retain profit as if no alteration were made.

- The new calculated premium might be larger than the office premium for a new policy at the lower sum assured.

c. Equate policy values on original premium basis:

- The method should be affordable, provided the policy value before the alteration is less than the asset share and the original premium basis is still appropriate at the date of alteration.

- Using the policy value on the original premium basis extracts the accrued profit from the original policy.

- There is no mention of adjusting for initial expenses in the premium bases to the extent that these are not required. However commission would be paid on the increased premium.

- There is also no mention of the costs of the alteration. It is therefore unlikely that expenses have been correctly allowed for.

- It should be checked that the sum assured of the altered policy is more than the sum assured available under the boundary condition of using the increase in premium to buy a new policy (and keeping the original policy).

- There is an anti-selection risk that relatively unhealthy policyholders will increase the benefits under an endowment assurance policy. If there is no additional underwriting being done, then the original pricing basis may not be appropriate for the altered product.

ii. Withdrawal assumption:

- The withdrawal assumptions should reflect the expected future experience in respect of the contracts that will be taken out, and should include an allowance for trends.

- There have been high sales volumes so the insurer should have internal data to use for this exercise.

- Data will be divided into homogenous groups, but subject to having enough data in each group to make the analysis for that group statistically credible.

- Internal data from the bank business can be used, but may not be sufficient for longer durations as it is a relatively new product and most policies may not have expired.

- Internal data from the bank business might need to be adjusted to allow for any significant differences between the original and the new product, e.g. a different premium structure or different market.

- Where withdrawal data is insufficient the insurer may rely on the withdrawal experience from other distribution channels and/or industry data.

- Adjustments will need to be made to industry data and internal data from other distribution channels, as distribution channel is likely to affect withdrawals.

- Industry data and withdrawal experience for other distribution channels can be used to adjust withdrawal rates at durations where internal data are not sufficient.

- The results of such analyses should be assessed to see if they have been affected by special factors such as an adverse economic situation in the country.

In part (ii) many candidates did not take note of the question's instruction and mark allocation, and provided too much detail on the calculation of the withdrawal rate and omitted an adequate description of the (high-level) process.

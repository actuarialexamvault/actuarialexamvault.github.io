## QUESTION 5

i. Possible information that could be gathered:

- Medical questions e.g. current health and treatment, personal and family medical history.

- Lifestyle questions e.g. participating in dangerous sporting activities and other hazardous past-times.

- Financial questions e.g. income relative to sum assured.

- Other questions e.g. smoking habits and occupation. How these can be included in the sales process:

- Simple underwriting questions can be included as part of the call script or proposal form.

- The insurer will need to be very selective in choosing questions to minimise time of the sales call.

- These questions would need to be near the end of the script so that the sales person only asks people that are likely to take out the cover.

- It is important that the sales person makes it clear that answers to these questions will materially affect the insurers assessment of the risk and that the claim may be repudiated or the claim amount adjusted if the person does not answer these questions accurately

ii. Additional ratios that could be used to investigate past experience.

- [Number of sales] / [Number of leads] This ratio provides information on how many leads end up being sales, which is an indication of the overall success of the distribution method.

- [Number of calls] / [Number of leads] This ratio provides information on how many leads are converted into calls, potentially indicating the quality of the leads that are being bought.

iii. Factors that could be used:
Quality of leads (based on information provided in lists):

- Source of leads:

- Different companies could be providing leads.

- Information about the policyholder:

- Age, gender, geographical location, salary, if this information is available, occupation, if this information is available. Only items that will be available on the list can be used to identify the quality of the lead. Insurer's process etc.:

- Call centre agent that made the call.

- Specific product that the agent tried to sell.

- Specific sales script that was used, if there is more than one script.

- Underwriting questions and whether further underwriting was required. (This can be used to determine whether the underwriting process is deterring potential sales).

iv. Reasons why it is important to monitor the sales experience:

- Setting pricing assumptions:

- The initial expenses incurred in selling a policy need to be allowed for in pricing.

- This would include the costs of obtaining the leads and running the call centre, which are incurred across all leads and calls, whether or not these result in successful sales, and other policy initiation costs.

- However, these costs can only be recouped from successful sales.

- Understanding the historical sales experience of the distribution model would thus allow the company to appropriately spread these initial expenses across only the successful sales.

- Optimising the sales strategy:

- Firstly the investigation would show whether the distribution method is performing sufficiently well in aggregate.

- This performance could be measured against performance targets of the call centre or against the performance that was assumed when the distribution method was launched.

- If results are split by call centre agent then it could be used to manage performance of the call centre staff by relating performance incentives to the success of each member.

- Analysing past experience across different homogeneous groups will also allow this distribution method to be optimised by allowing sales resources to be used most efficiently.

- This information can be used to target sales resources in any of the following ways:

- Target specific lead providers, as they might provide better quality leads.

- Target specific types of leads (e.g. income bracket).

- Certain products might sell better than others.

- Certain sales scripts might work better than others.

The question was handled reasonably well by candidates who were well prepared. Parts (iii) & (iv) were generally not answered well, with answers being too brief and generic in nature. In isolated cases candidates lost marks because they failed to answer all of the parts of the question, had numbering incorrect or produced illegible hand writing.

## QUESTION 6

i. Restrictions:

- Restrict the types of contracts that a life insurance company is permitted to sell.

- Restrict the premium rates (or charges) that can be used for some types of contracts.

- Requirements relating to the terms and conditions of the contracts offered.

- Restrictions on distribution, such as:

- the channels through which life insurance may be sold;

- the procedures to be followed for a sale;

- the information to be given as part of the selling process;

- minimum qualifications requirements for the sales staff;

- remuneration rules e.g. maximum commission payable.

- Restrictions on the ability to:

- underwrite; or

- differentiate between different classes of lives (e.g. males and females).

- Constraints on the amount of business that may be written (directly or through the requirement to hold a minimum level of reserves and minimum solvency margins.).

- Restrictions on permissible reinsurance.

- Requirements to "Treat customers fairly".

- Specifying reserved statutory roles e.g. statutory actuary must sign-off on solvency valuations.

ii. Product design considerations:

- Profitability:

- In theory, a life insurance company should be able to determine the level of charges so that profitability is unchanged.

- However, there may be a negative effect on profitability if there is indeed an increase in competition.

- Marketability (Attractiveness of product features to the client):

- Policyholders may find this charging structure easier to understand and therefore attractive.

- A relatively more simple product may also become more attractive to the sales staff (easier to distribute).

- Improved attractiveness of the product could increase sales volumes leading to lower per policy contributions required to cover fixed overheads.

- However, charges may appear relatively high (compared to a percentage-offund value charge, for example) and make products unattractive.

- Competitiveness (attractiveness of features compared to competitors' products):

- Level of charges may become a more important competitive factor.

- This may force companies to reduce their profit requirements and/or force them to sell the savings product as a loss leader.

- Some competitors may decide to exit the market, reducing the choice available to clients.

- But other product features, like past investment performance, may be a bigger driver of competition. It is therefore not clear that this proposal will result in increased competition.

- Insurance companies may attempt to differentiate their products through the introduction of other features (e.g. more investment choice), potentially limiting the impact of the proposal on competitiveness.

- Not all distribution channels are equally sensitive to price, again limiting the potential impact on competitiveness.

- Risk:

- Both types of charges are level for the duration of the contract, which reduces an insurance company's upfront income (i.e. ability to front-end load on regular premium products).

- This is less of a problem for single premium products.

- Therefore there may be a larger mismatch between initial expenses and income, which increases withdrawal risk early on in the contract.

- This may result in a requirement to increase surrender penalties (at early durations in particular).

- Because charges are level, there is an increase in inflation risk.

- However, this risk is mitigated to some extent on regular premium contracts if premiums escalate over the contract term, or where charges can be reviewed.

- Charges are not dependent on fund values and therefore this would decrease investment risk (if charges were previously levied as a percentage of fund).

- Financing:

- Mismatching of charges may also require additional working capital from shareholders, making these products potentially more expensive. Because there are no fund-related charges, actuarial funding will no longer be an option, which decreases the capital efficiency of these products.

- However, the company may still be able to use negative non-unit reserves to reduce new business strain (if allowed by the regulator).

- Sensitivity of profit:

- Cross-subsidies:

- Since charges are level across different policy terms the new structure would increase any cross-subsidy that exists between longer term and shorter term products.

- A level monetary amount has a relatively larger impact on small premium policies (assuming the monetary amount does not vary by premium size), making small premium products relatively unattractive.

- If charges are level across different policy sizes or between products with relatively large premiums and relatively small premiums this increases business mix risk.

- May be viewed as unfair by policyholders that want to invest large premiums.

- Administration:

- It is unlikely that any changes to the administration systems would be required, given that these types of charges are probably already part of the existing product design.

- However, administration should be simpler because the design has been simplified.

- There may be some costs in retraining staff, reprinting training material and product material etc.

- Consistency with existing business:

- Some policyholders may surrender their existing products, if the new product provides better value for money.

- Life insurance companies will have to consider whether they want to offer conversion terms from the old to the new product.

- Regulatory requirements:

- Not applicable. Part (i) was standard bookwork, with the better prepared candidates scoring well. In part (ii) the candidates that followed a structured approach did best. Answers had to be specific, and thus generic comments (e.g. "the actuary should ensure that charges match expenses") did not gain credit. Some candidates demonstrated that they did not know the difference between premiums, charges and expenses. A more conservative pricing basis will lead to an increase in charges, but not necessarily an increase in premiums on the savings product. The "level" charge will not increase in line with inflation, but need not necessarily be guaranteed. Both alternatives were accepted, however.

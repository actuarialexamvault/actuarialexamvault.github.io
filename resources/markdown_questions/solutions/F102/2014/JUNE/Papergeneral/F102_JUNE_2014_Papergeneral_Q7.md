## QUESTION 7

i. Advantages:

- The cashflow method allows for assumed experience to vary over time,

- e.g. mortality improvements.

- This allows a stochastic model to be built for deriving a distribution of reserve level and for valuation of options.

- It allows more easily for complex benefit structures,

- e.g. where charges and benefits depend on future assumptions such as unitlinked business should the company sell this in future.

- The risk discount rate can take account of the term structure of interest rates.

- Tax can be allowed for more appropriately.

- Can more easily allow explicitly for future bonuses. Disadvantages:

- Formula method is much easier and quicker to calculate.

- Formula does not require establishing/purchasing complex and expensive models.

- Formula requires fewer assumptions.

ii. Comments:

- While reversionary bonuses have remained level at 4% p.a., it seems likely that policyholder expectations for regular bonuses are based on real returns.

- These have been decreasing due to increasing inflation.

- The reserving basis is the same as the premium basis, resulting in no initial capitalisation of margins and instead surplus emergence is deferred over the life of the contract.

- With investment returns at 10% p.a., the surplus emerging each year is 5% p.a. (the difference between the actual and reserving interest rates).

- With regular bonuses at 4% p.a., the remaining undistributed surplus of 1% p.a. is deferred and can be distributed as a terminal bonus.

- The proposal to increase regular bonuses to 6% p.a. is not feasible as this exceeds the investment surplus emerging and would lead to an erosion of free assets.

- The maximum that regular bonuses could be increased to is 5% p.a., however this leads to no deferral of surplus for terminal bonuses, and this is also likely to make policyholders unhappy.

- Even 5% p.a. regular bonuses are unlikely to meet policyholder expectations as this is lower than inflation.

- If other items of actual experience (e.g. mortality, surrenders) are similar to the reserving basis, these items will not give rise to any additional surplus.

- However if other items generate sufficient surplus each year the company might be able to afford 6% p.a. regular bonuses.

- One option for the company is to consider a more aggressive investment strategy that will yield higher real returns such as equities and property.

iii. Investment principles:

- The principles of investment are that an insurance company should select investments that are appropriate to the nature, term and currency of its liabilities.

- The extent to which the company may depart from investing in appropriate investments in order to match its liabilities, depends amongst other things on the extent of the company's free assets. Or (for second two bullets) these investment principles can also be expressed as:

- The life insurance company should invest so as to maximise the overall return on the assets, subject to the risks being taken on being within the financial resources available to it.

iv. Comments:

- The current split of assets and liabilities (as % of total) is: Assets % Liabilities % Local equities 26% With profit Offshore equities 2% - SA+RB declared 38% Direct property 5% - RB future 19% Fixed Interest 53% - TB future 19% Cash 14% Surplus assets 24% Total 100% Total 100%

- To consider the appropriateness of the asset allocation of the insurer one needs to consider the nature of the liabilities, level of free assets and policyholder reasonable expectations regarding future bonuses.

- Benefits guaranteed in money terms (i.e. sums assured + declared RB) are best matched by assets providing returns fixed in monetary terms such as fixed interest stocks of suitable term.

- The holding of fixed interest (53%) is much higher than might be suggested by the liabilities.

- We cannot comment on the appropriateness of the assets in terms of term or currency as no information has been provided on this.

- The most suitable assets for discretionary benefits (i.e. future RB and terminal bonuses) depend on:

- Level of free assets is high at 3x required level, implying greater investment freedom.

- Policyholder expectations which are likely to be for real returns.

- Any published or expected investment strategy.

- Equities, property and index-linked stocks are likely to provide the best match for discretionary liabilities.

- The minimum solvency margin would usually be invested conservatively, such as cash.

- It seems like the company has sufficient cash to achieve this level of conservativeness.

- Surplus assets: The excess, which may be invested in assets expected to provide a real return, or cash if the company is planning to utilise these for investment opportunities or new business growth.

- The amount allocated to direct property suggests that perhaps this is only a single investment:

- This leads to lack of diversification.

- However, the property might be used by the company itself.

- Indirect property would provide greater diversification benefits.

- Expenses linked to inflation are best matched by linked assets (in this case assets whose returns are likely to match expense inflation, such as equities and property).

- It appears that investment in real assets is low for this company (given the nature of the liabilities and the level of free assets), and that the director is correct that returns could be enhanced by investing more heavily in equities.

- The current asset split might not be a long-term split, but a tactical position away from the long-term strategic position due to mispricing in the investment markets

- e.g. fixed interest may be offering good value relative to equities and this is the reason for the asset split. If surplus is equal to required level:

- Surplus funds equal to required level implies the company is barely solvent, and the company would have no investment freedom.

- The company would need to match its guaranteed liabilities very closely (with fixed interest assets).

increase the bonus rate, not realising that 5% p.a. return was used in the premium rate (and must therefore be earned) to support the sum assured.
Part (iii) was easy bookwork, and thus was done well.
Part (iv) was a relatively easy investments question which was not answered well by many candidates. A number of candidates resorted to making general comments without an analysis using the information provided. Many candidates made comments based on incorrect analysis e.g. guaranteed liabilities as a percentage of total liabilities (50%) compared to say fixed interest as a percentage of total assets (53%). As total liabilities are not equal to total assets, this comparison is faulty and often led to incorrect comments. A large number of candidates simply made assumptions (without making this clear) about the currency of the liabilities (usually assuming there were no foreign liabilities) and making comments based on those assumptions. A number of candidates commented on the proposal to increase bonus rates and made no comments on the proposal to increase equity holdings.

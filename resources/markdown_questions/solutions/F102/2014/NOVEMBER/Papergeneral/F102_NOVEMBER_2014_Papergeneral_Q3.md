## QUESTION 3

(i)
With-profit design:

- The product provides a combination of savings for retirement and risk protection (on death) and disability which makes it more marketable.

- The with-profit design with fairly stable surrender and maturity values, although this depends on the mix between reversionary and terminal bonus rates.

- The company's historic practice on with-profits business bonuses, specifically how its bonuses compare to the rest of the market, as this affects the company's reputation.

- Some less risk-averse investors may prefer a "pure" unit link design rather than a with-profits design. The definition of disability and benefit amounts:

- The product does not cover temporary disability which may make the product less marketable. But this will probably make the product relatively cheaper (fewer claims although paid for longer period once in payment).

- Payable to age 65 (or normal retirement age) and so can replace income during working life. But fairly restrictive e.g. only single maturity date => less marketable.

- Since the unit fund is used to purchase the annuity benefit there no link with actual income before disability, which does not meet policyholder needs. But there is a minimum income guarantee.

- The product provides an income while some policyholder's may prefer a lump sum.

- The impact of the surrender penalty depends on its size and how it compares to market, but generally negative view. Premiums and charges:

- Annual premiums might be too expensive for clients who would prefer paying lower monthly premiums.

- The price will have to be compared to competitors, if possible.

- The minimum guarantee is likely to increase the cost.

- Charges are largely a percentage of assets and so will be cheap for small premium policies (marketable) but relatively expensive for larger premium policies (less marketable). Distribution:

- Will need to pay reasonable/competitive commission rates.

- Channel would also need to be appropriate (the complexity makes it unsuitable for direct channels). Underwriting requirements and eligibility restrictions:

- Only available for purchase up to age 50, which might restrict the marketability of the product.

- Strict underwriting will generally reduce marketability. But that is dependent on how it compares to the market practice. Simplicity:

- The simple/transparent charging structure improves marketability.

- But the benefit design is fairly complicated (age restrictions, different events etc.) and the definition of permanent disability may not be easily understood by policyholders. General:

- Reputation of insurer would impact marketability, but since insurer has got good range of products, it is at least possibly known in the market, so that could help/not depending on reputation .

- No guarantees on death or maturity, so less certainty for clients, but this makes product cheaper.

(ii)
Both product designs are unitised therefore:

- Charges deducted (as specified) through cancellation of units. For unit-linked product designs the unit price fluctuates daily in line with values of assets in fund and the investment risk is borne by policyholders for unit-linked. For accumulating with-profit (AWP) the value of the units changes depending on the bonus declaration by the company. Hence risks shared between policyholders and shareholders for

AWP.

- Bonus declarations will be split between reversionary (regular) and terminal bonus (dependent on product design).

- Declarations will be made periodically (e.g. monthly).

- The guaranteed minimum bonus rate is usually zero.

- Once-off bonus interest could be added (special reversionary bonus).

- This bonus could be additional units or a change in the price of the units. Bonus rates would be smoothed over time for AWP and there may be a market value reduction for AWP (but not on the unit-linked) to reflect the realistic value of the asset share. Charges for unit-linked design should be lower, because the AWP has a guaranteed minimum return of 0% that would need to be recouped from charges. For both product designs there is a surrender penalty (as defined above). In both cases premiums may be reviewable depending on the underlying performance of the assets (and therefore) unit funds. Examiners comments: For part (i) candidates who listed the general factors that affect a product's marketability were not given credit unless they related the factor to this specific product. In part (ii) Candidates did not explain differences very well and very few candidates spoke about the details surrounding bonus declarations on the AWP contracts.

## QUESTION 4

(i)
Consideration of how profits for the company will change on alterations going forward.
For the old basis: Use of the current premium basis to determine the policy value before the alteration will extract the "accrued" profit for the period up to the date of alteration, for policies that were sold on this premium basis. Determining the policy value after the alteration on the current premium basis will give expected profit over the remaining life of the contract corresponding with that from current new policies. This combination results in an "appropriate" amount of profit for the company, assuming that new business terms were profitable.
For the new basis: Profit depends on the basis used to calculate paid-up policy (PUP) values. If the company calculates PUP values so that expected profit is the same as that from an unconverted contract, an excessive profit will be made using this alteration method.
Other considerations for the new basis The company will have to make adjustment to avoid double charging of initial expenses and initial commission, except to the extent of any additional expenses/commission payable at the alteration date.
The company should check that the policy after the alteration is supportable by the asset share at the alteration date in order to avoid making an expected loss.

The method used could be consistent with the basis used for new business, depending on basis used to calculate PUP value (e.g. if it also used current basis or even original premium basis to calculation PUP value) This method could possibly be easier to explain and be easier to calculate if the PUP value is available.
The new method is not suitable for all alterations e.g. paid-up, whereas current method is.
Boundary conditions probably better met by old basis although new basis has consistency with new premium basis for the balance of sum assured The insurer needs to consider the following issues when changing the alteration basis:

- Whether policy conditions for existing business allow such a change to be made.

- PRE need to be managed to ensure that policyholders understand the change. For current policyholders there is a reputational risk if they feel they are getting a worse value on alteration. The insurer may experience lower sales if new policyholders do not appreciate the new basis

- New marketing literature would have to be printed.

- Admin systems would have to be changed .

- Staff would have to be trained on the changes.

- Whether there are any regulations relating to changing basis that need to be taken into account.

- Which method is competitors using (could affect sales and retention).

- Basis should not be changed too often (the pros and cons between methods should be carefully considered before making the change).

- Alteration terms should ensure fairness/be equitable between altering and non-altering customers.

(ii)
An expense analysis would normally be performed to determine what costs are incurred in alterations.
The company would generally split expenses into expenses relating to new business, existing business, terminations and investments. Alteration expenses are usually part of the existing business expenses. The insurer would consider whether cost/benefit requires/allows for alteration expenses to be split from existing business expenses. If so, subdivide the existing business expenses between alterations and other expenses. Could sub-divide expenses by type of alteration, but generally grouped together for simplicity.
If there is alterations department handling alterations, then staff costs, rent by floor space occupied and system and IT costs (pragmatically) of this department could be allocated to the alteration cost.
The company may track how long it actually takes to do an alteration and using salary levels of employees to calculate an estimate.
Alternatively, the analysis can be based on similar administration expenses e.g. the cost of issuing a policy.
Alteration expense is likely to be a per policy expense, not linked to sum assured or premium.
So alteration expenses will be divided by the number of alterations to get the per policy expense.
Allowance should be made for future trends and expense inflation as well as the development cost of new alteration bases if it is going to be implemented.

Examiners' comments For part (i) many candidates listed the general factors to consider for alterations but this scored no or very few marks. To score well, candidates needed to make the factors relevant to the proposed or previous bases e.g. that lapse and re-entry will be prevented with proposed new basis because the PUP value is taken into account, but for new contract the whole sum assured would need to be funded from new premiums. Also, only factors that need to be considered upon changing the basis needed to be listed, not all factors that would also have been a consideration for old basis.
Few candidates scored well in part (ii). Many candidates interpreted it as the renewal expense loadings to be used for altered products, instead of how to determine the cost of alteration that should be loaded at alteration stage (i.e. alteration cost). Any appropriate method to identify costs associated with alteration and dividing by number of alterations scored marks.

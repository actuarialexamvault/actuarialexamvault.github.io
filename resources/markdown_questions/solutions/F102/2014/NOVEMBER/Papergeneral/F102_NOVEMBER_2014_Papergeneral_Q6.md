## QUESTION 6

(i)
a) Claims incurred but not settled before the valuation date Reported claims For claims reported but not yet assessed, provide for the claim amounts and allow for the probability of paying for these claims based on past experience.
For reported claims that were assessed and are valid, provide for 100% of the claim.
Incurred but not reported claims (IBNRs) For the death/ disability incurred but not reported setup IBNRs based on chain ladder techniques, for example Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.
Simple risk premium approach Alternatively, a simple risk premium approach can be used, whereby the IBNR is set equal to a certain number of months of risk premiums, where the number of months is based on the average delay in claims reported. b) Policyholder liability for whole of life product According to the gross premium valuation method policyholder liabilities are determined as the present value of future benefit outgo plus the present value of expected future expenses less the present value of expected future premiums.
The policyholder liabilities will include an allowance for:

- Future death, disability and loyalty bonus benefits

- Future administration expenses

- Future premiums The projection term must reflect the nature of the benefit i.e. project to the terminal age, say 100, for the whole-life death benefit.

- Taking into account expected mortality rates and lapse rates, based on the policyholder profile

- These assumptions are likely to be prudent, including an appropriate margin for adverse experience

- The discount rate should be based on the yields of assets matching the liabilities or the risk-free rate.

(ii)
Existing business The move to a best-estimate basis for determining the policyholder liabilities for the whole of life product should result in the release of the margins for prudence required in the previous valuation basis.
All else equal, this would reduce the policyholder liabilities and result in a once-off profit emerging to the insurer at the first valuation date after the change in regulations.
For subsequent valuations, since all assumptions have to be on the expected future experience, no future profits are expected from the in-force business.
This is because all future cash flows are expected to be exactly matched by the release in the policyholder reserve and investment return.
New business Since the policyholder liabilities are required to be calculated on a best-estimate of expected future experience, all expected profits associated with new business will be released up-front.
No profits are then expected in the future.
(iii)
The regulator may introduce or increase the minimum level of solvency capital required to be held by insurers. This could be in the form of a minimum monetary amount and an amount based on the business written by the insurer. This amount should take the risk of different experience into account at a confidence level that will satisfy the regulator.
Examiners' comments Question 6 was poorly attempted with only a few candidates realising part of the question is straight forward book work. In addition candidates made too few points for the mark allocation; it seems as if candidates assumed to get a full mark for one concept, where it was only half a mark.
In parts (i) and (ii) most candidates failed to score marks because they did not explicitly use the terms IBNRs and outstanding claims. Several answers were too vague, touching on the right concepts but giving to little detail to score marks.
Overall, most candidates realised that a best-estimate valuation will accelerate profits for part (iii). But, only the strong candidates realised that no profit is expected in future and that the source will be experience profit only.

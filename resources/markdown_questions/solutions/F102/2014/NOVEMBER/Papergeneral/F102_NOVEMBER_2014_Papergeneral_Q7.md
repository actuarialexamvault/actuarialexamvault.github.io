## QUESTION 7

(i)
Medical underwriting:

- Applicants will need to complete an application form.

- This will include answering medical questions.

- If necessary based on the sum insured or initial answers to the medical questions, further medical tests or an examination by the doctor may be required.

- For high sums insured an HIV test may be required.

- The medical underwriting decision could be to accept at standard rates, defer acceptance, load the premium, place an exclusion on the policy, or decline the policy. Avocational/occupational underwriting:

- They will also need to be asked about hazardous pursuits, which may lead to a loading or exclusion.

- They will also need to be asked about travel to dangerous countries, which may lead to a loading or exclusion. Financial underwriting:

- The applicant will need to provide details on his/her income so that the underwriter can assess if the level of insurance is appropriate.

- This should include a requirement to demonstrate proof of income.

- The underwriter should check if there are any other policies, income or lump sum disability, to ensure there is no over insurance. Claims management/ claims underwriting - at claims stage the claims assessor must ensure that:

- The claimant meets the definition of disability.

- There was no non-disclosure at policy application.

- The claim is not due to a condition or pursuit that was excluded.

- There is loss of earnings (to the extent that this is a requirement to make a valid claim).

- The income prior to disability is consistent with what was disclosed at the initial underwriting stage (to the extent that this is required to make a valid claim). Claims underwriting/ claims management - for ongoing claims the claims assessor must ensure that:

- The claimant continues to meet the definition of disability.

- The frequency at which this is done will depend on the nature of the claim Credit was given for giving points on product design features included to manage claims (e.g. maximum replacement ratios), but it was not possible to score full marks by only discussing these points.

(ii)
Under the old regime the policyholder gets tax relief on the insurance premium and the tax authority only receives tax when someone claims. Therefore the tax authority collects less tax as most people will not claim.
Since the new tax regime applies to existing policies the tax authorities will have granted tax relief on benefits that will not be taxed in the future, resulting in less tax collected for existing policies.
Under the new regime tax is collected earlier, so there will be a time value of money benefit for the tax authorities.
Under the new regime policyholders do not get tax relief. So, assuming that premiums paid are less than benefits paid, which in the long run they should be, the government will receive more tax under the new regime.
It is also possible that the change is to simplify the tax policy and make it consistent across all benefits.
(iii)
Possible negative consequences: Current policyholders could now be over-insured as their benefit would no longer need to be taxed. This would lead to an increase in the replacement ratio for current policyholders, this in turn could lead to:

- An increase in current benefits in payment, significantly reducing the likelihood of termination.

- Requests to change benefit levels & premiums.

- Lapse & re-entry. The removal of tax relief could result in current premiums becoming unaffordable. Future sales may reduce owing to the loss of tax relief on premiums, this in turn could lead to:

- Brokers being less willing to try to sell the policies.

- The company having fewer policies from which to recoup fixed expenses. But this is offset to some extent by the fact that benefit levels can be reduced for future products, as they are now based on post-tax policyholder needs and not pre-tax policyholder needs. It will be more difficult to determine an appropriate benefit level as the benefit level will need to be set to approximate the policyholder's after-tax income. This is complicated by the fact that the policyholder's future tax position is uncertain and could change between policy inception and claim stage, either due to the changes in tax regulations or changes in the policyholder's circumstances. This in turn may lead to:

- Dissatisfied policyholders, and reputational damage, at claim stage.

- The lower benefit levels (which should in future target net income) may look lower than in the past, impacting sales. Increased costs involved in communicating changes to existing policyholders as well as the sales force.

(iv)
Pricing / product design: Change the product/contract to operate on net income.

- This seems obvious, but it isn't always clear what tax rate will apply at claim stage, and hence your calculation is only an estimate.

- For in-force policies you may not be able to change the contract terms.

- Also, this may be difficult to implement from a systems point of view.

- You will also have to make sure the brokers understand the impact of using net income (as the benefit may look less, but actually the policyholder is still expected to get the same benefit out). Make the product more expensive to mitigate some of the risk factors.

- This will make it even harder to sell and you may just drive the good risks away. Remove any premium guarantee on new products.

- This gives you more flexibility to manage profitability, but it makes the product less attractive and may impact sales negatively. For in-force claims, it is unlikely that the insurer would be able to reduce the benefit to the equivalent net benefit.

- Contract wording is unlikely to accommodate a reduction in benefits for in-force claims.

- If it were possible the claimant should receive a refund of premiums for the difference between the gross and net benefits.

- Even if your contract allows you to do this, it is likely to violate treating customers fairly principles and it is a very bad marketing message. "We are going to reduce the benefits of the poor disabled people". For in-force claims, ensure that over-insured individuals return to work if they can.

- This could be achieved by more intensive active claims monitoring and strict applications of the conditions for claimants to return to work.

- Which would increase claim stage expenses. Existing policyholders (not claiming):

- You could write to existing 'healthy' policyholder and offer them a reduction in premiums and benefits, to bring benefits in line with the net of tax benefit level. New claims from existing policyholders:

- The insurer could apply more thorough assessment of claims at the claims inception stage.

- But this is likely to increase the cost and time for claims assessment.

- Repudiation of claims may have a negative impact on the insurer's reputation. Reinsurance Reinsure a larger portion of this product. . But reinsurers may charge "appropriately" for the change in legislation, i.e. allow for the impact which the change in legislation will have, in which case you will be no better off. Examiners' comments Candidates generally scored poorly in this question. For part (i) many candidates gave general information of the features of an income protection product rather than focusing on underwriting and claims management. The majority of candidates did not provide sufficient information on the types of underwriting and claims assessment that may be used for an income protection product. Few candidates considered ongoing claims management in the context of an income protection product. Many candidates failed to identify the 'time value of money' advantage of the tax authorities receiving tax earlier in part (ii). Many candidates gave points from the policyholders' perspective, when the question asked for the tax authority's perspective. Many candidates did not score well in part (iii) because they failed to relate their points to the type of product in the question (income protection) and gave general answered that would apply to any type of product. Most candidates failed to identify overinsurance as the main issue in the change in the tax regime and did not consider how seemingly lower benefits would affect sales. Discussion around the consequences of this change was generally vague with candidates failing to justify their points (e.g. why sales would drop. A number of candidates discussed issues around investments, when reserves for income protection products would generally be relatively small. For part (iv) candidates who structured their answers around product design issues and actions for different types of policyholders (i.e. claimants, existing policyholders and new policyholders) were able to score more marks.

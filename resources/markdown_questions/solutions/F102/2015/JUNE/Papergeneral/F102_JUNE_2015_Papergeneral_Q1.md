## QUESTION 1

i. Product features:

- Pays a regular income to the insured during incapacity.

- Incapacity is based on illness or injury as defined in the policy wording.

- Definitions of incapacity are often based on occupation, activities of daily living (ADL) or activities of daily work (ADW).

- Benefits are usually limited, based on replacement ratios to prevent overinsurance.

- Proportionate benefits can be paid to encourage return to some form of employment after rehabilitation.

- Benefits are paid until the insured recovers, dies or the maximum term of the policy is reached.

- The maximum policy term will not extend beyond the insured's normal retirement age.

- Exclusions vary but may include attempted suicide, or self-inflicted injury.

- There is usually a deferred period for which the insured must be sick before a claim is paid.

- There may be a waiting period at the start of the contract during which time no benefit will be paid.

- Premiums and benefits can be level or increase with inflation.

- Any increases are normally limited to a specified percentage.

- Policy can have single premiums or regular premiums.

- Premiums can be reviewable or guaranteed.

- Policy terms may include a linked claim condition - whereby the deferred period will not be applied if sickness recurs within a short period of returning to work.

ii. The claim termination data could be grouped by:

- Duration since claim started

- Cause of claim

- Age

- Gender

- Deferred period

- Waiting period

- Type of termination (recovery or death)

- Benefit escalation rate

- Replacement ratio

Issues to consider:

- If necessary, recombine certain groups to ensure there is enough information per cell for the analysis to be credible

- Consider any factors that would weaken the relevance of past data.

- For example, income protection experience depends a heavily on state of the economy

- May want to try and model recovery rates linked to level of economy

- Consider any trends in the data.

- It may be very difficult to find a suitable period that has sufficient data, but where the data are relevant to the expected future environment.

iii. Experience may differ due to differences in:

- Target market

- Periods of investigation

- Claims management processes

- Definitions of claims

- Interpretations of the same definition between different companies

- Levels of maximum benefits

- Escalation rates

- Deferred periods

- Waiting periods

- Replacement ratios Those candidates who were well prepared and wrote an appropriate amount scored reasonably well. Those who did not score well generally made too few points. Some candidates made the fundamental mistake of failing to follow the instruction in the question (e.g. "comment"), and thereby gave inappropriate answers.

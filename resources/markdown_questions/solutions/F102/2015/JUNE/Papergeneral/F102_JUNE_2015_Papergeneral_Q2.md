## QUESTION 2

i. Factors to consider:

- The insurer will consider whether the terminal bonus will be affordable or negatively affect the solvency of the fund / company.

- The terminal bonus will be set relative to the difference between the asset share and benefits guaranteed to date at the policy maturity date (initial guarantee plus reversionary bonuses).

- Bonus distribution should be fair to different categories or generations of policyholders.

- The insurer will "smooth" the payouts, to reduce the impact on the policyholder of fluctuations in investment markets.

- The extent of smoothing that can be applied will depend on policyholder reasonable expectations.

- Policyholder reasonable expectations will be built up from product documentation, past practice of the insurer and market practice.

- The insurer will need to comply with policy terms and conditions, for example it is likely that the terminal bonus cannot be negative.

- The affordability of the terminal bonus will be considered in the light of future business plans (e.g. the impact on potential future new business) and terminal bonus rates declared by competitors.

ii. The policy reserves using the gross premium valuation method are calculated as the
present value of future benefit outgo plus the present value of expected future expenses less the present value of expected future office premiums.
All liabilities to policyholders arising out of the contracts should be allowed for, incl.:

- Guaranteed benefits or options available to benefits

- Guaranteed surrender values (the amount of the reserves for each policy should be at least as great as the surrender value)

- Bonuses which have already been guaranteed (vested, declared or allotted bonuses)

- Future bonuses (regular reversionary bonuses and may include terminal bonuses)

- The allowance for future bonuses needs to be consistent with both the reasonable expectations of policyholders and the assumed future investment and other experience Expenses (including commission) are explicitly allowed for.

- This allowance may consider the possibility of the company ceasing to write new business, if that would increase the reserve.

On the supervisory valuation assumptions, future surpluses are projected to emerge in a suitable pattern and amount so as to match the assumed future regular bonuses.
Negative reserves may have to be eliminated for the purpose of demonstrating solvency.
The discount rate should be based on the yields of assets matching the liabilities or the risk-free rate.
The discount rate can be reduced to implicitly allow for future bonus declarations.
The projection term should reflect the expected term of the policy.
The basis chosen should recognise profit appropriately over the duration of each policy.
Care needs to be taken in setting the basis, because differences between the valuation basis and office premium basis will be capitalised immediately.
iii. The regulator could set up requirements:

- For the board of the insurer to consider the fair treatment of policyholders in the bonus declaration.

- For an independent advisor (e.g. actuary) to give input to the board on the fair treatment of with-profits policyholders.

- For the insurer to set up a bonus policy that considers the fair treatment of policyholders.

- For minimum and simple to understand disclosure in product literature on the bonus projections, bonus philosophy and investment portfolio supporting the with-profits policies of the insurer.

- For minimum and simple to understand disclosure on the risks relating to the investment strategy for the with-profits funds.

## QUESTION 3

i. Factors affecting the distribution of the accumulated unit fund at maturity:

- Size of single premium.

- Policy term.

- Allocation rate.

- Unit fund charges.

- If unit fund charges are performance related they could also affect the shape parameter.

- Investments underlying the unit fund, including the split by asset class.

- Statistical distribution assumed for investment returns on each asset class.

- Interdependence (correlation) that is assumed for investment returns between different asset classes.

- Assumptions about future investment strategy.

- For example, whether the portfolio is rebalanced if the balance is distorted by investment returns.

ii. Probability of guarantee biting:
P (guarantee biting) = P (Unit fund at maturity < R1m) = P ( [ (Unit fund at maturity - R1.3m) / R0.2m ] < [ (R1m - R1.3m) / R0.2m] ) = P (z < - R1.5m) = 6.68%

iii. Hedging its exposure to this guarantee:
The company can match the cost of the guarantee by investing in a European put option that has the following characteristics:

- Underlying assets are consistent with the assets underlying the unit fund

- Strike price = R1m

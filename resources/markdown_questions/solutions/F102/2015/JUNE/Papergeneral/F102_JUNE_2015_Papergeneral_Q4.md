## QUESTION 4

i. The advantages of this product for the policyholder are:

- The product encourages 'forced' regular savings for the child's education, creating a savings habit.

- While marketed as an education policy the benefits can be used for other financial needs, e.g. repaying mortgage, so it is flexible.

- The smoothed bonus fund should provide real investment growth, which would be required to meeting inflating costs of education.

- There is also no downside of negative bonuses and less exposure to the potentially volatile returns of unit-linked / market-related policies.

- The premium is flexible and can be selected based on the desired maturity benefit.

- The surrender value provides a payout if the policyholder's needs/priorities change.

- The two partial withdrawals provide cashflow for unforeseen smaller expenses during the policy term.

- On death the policy can continue as paid-up and thus still contribute towards a child's education, or can be surrendered to meet funeral expenses.

- The waiver of premium option provides some protection in the event of the death or disability of the policyholder and allows the policy to remain in-force in the event of the early death or disability of the parent.

- It is possible that there may be some tax benefit, e.g. income tax relief may be received on the premiums, or the final maturity benefit may be paid free of income tax.

ii. The risks that the insurer needs to consider in introducing this product include:
Data:

- The fact that the product has been developed for a new target market will mean that the insurer will not have appropriate internal data for the setting of assumptions, e.g. mortality and morbidity.

- The insurer could make use of industry data (if available) or reinsurers' data.

- However, this may come at a cost. Investment risk:

- The fact that bonuses may not be negative places investment risk on the company as bonuses form part of the guaranteed benefits once declared.

- Investment risk can be passed back to policyholders via reduced bonuses, but this will also impact the future marketability of the product.

- However, the extent to which these tools can be used depends on expectations of policyholders and practice of competitors.

- The company runs the risk of return on assets backing the waiver of premium benefit being lower than expected.

- Low fund values will result in low management charges. Reputational risk:

- Policyholders will expect a reasonable level of real return, in the form of regular and terminal bonuses, throughout the term of the policy.

- In particular, policyholders may expect growth to keep pace with increases in the costs of tertiary education.

- They may compare the regular bonuses received during the policy term to:

- interest rates on bank savings accounts;

- investment returns on education products from other insurers;

- investment returns on savings in other investment products (e.g. unit trusts);

- projections in the policy literature.

- This risk could be made worse if the company does not have an established track record of providing competitive bonuses on with profits business.

- It is important that the policyholders understand the (reasonably complex) contract to avoid reputational risk and high lapses.

- Any inability to meet policyholders' bonus expectations could result in reduced sales and increased lapses. Mortality and morbidity risk:

- For policies without the waiver of premium benefit death would result in a surrender or conversion to paid-up. The extent of the risk will depend on the terms for surrender or conversion (see below).

- For policies with the waiver of premium benefit there is the risk that the insurer underestimates the mortality and/or morbidity experience for this benefit.

- If more policyholders die/become disabled or if they die/become disabled earlier than expected the insurer will have to pay more waiver of premium benefits and possibly pay benefits for a longer period than anticipated.

- This can also occur if the waiver of premium benefit ceases on recovery from a disability, and the rates of recovery have been overestimated.

- The uncertainty relating to future mortality and morbidity is increased due to the minimal underwriting.

- The minimal underwriting could also increase anti-selection.

- The business can be reinsured in order to reduce the risk, however:

- this will also reduce the expected profitability of the business; and

- exposes the reinsurer to the risk of the reinsurer defaulting.

- There is an added risk in respect of the waiver of premium benefit relating to the definition of permanent disability. If the definition is not clear and understood by policyholders it could result in:

- more claims having to be paid than expected; and/or

Withdrawal risk:

- There is a risk of higher than expected surrenders at early stages when the asset share is negative.

- At later durations, the level of risk depends upon the relationship between the asset share and the discontinuance terms.

- The extent of surrender penalties may be limited by market practice and policyholder expectations.

- This product is marketed to the lower-income government employees, the risk of withdrawal due to a lack of affordability of the premium may be a higher risk than for the current target market of the insurer, increasing risk if this increase is difficult to estimate.

- Some surrender risk may be passed on to the policyholder through lower bonuses (but this is limited by the need to remain competitive and the need to meet PRE).

- This is also true for expense risk.

- The company is also exposed to risks from partial withdrawals being higher than expected, as this would reduce the annual fund management charges, with at least some of the administration expenses being unchanged. Expense and volume risk:

- There is a risk that the company underestimates the expenses it incurs to administer the policy and that the charges are insufficient for the actual expenses incurred and contribution to shareholders profit.

- There could also be a mismatch in timing between expenses (e.g. the high initial expenses) and charges.

- The inflation assumption used in pricing may have been insufficient resulting in expenses growing at a faster rate than assumed.

- In deriving the expense assumptions, the insurance company will have made assumptions regarding the likely volume and mix of business written on this product. This may be difficult to estimate as the target market is not familiar to the company.

- A different mix of business (e.g. by premium size) to that assumed in the pricing, may lead to incorrect charges for expenses if cross-subsidisation is taking place.

- Lower than expected volumes of business (either through low new business or poor persistency) will lead to lower contributions to development costs, fixed costs and shareholder profit.

- If the company writes more business than expected:

- there may be insufficient capital to support initial costs and regulatory reserving requirements; and

- there may be undue pressure on the insurers systems and operational staff (causing errors, delays and customer dis-satisfaction).

Competition and marketing risk:

- There is a risk that competition may negatively impact on business volumes.

- Competitors' products may be more attractive to policyholders due to innovative product features, lower charges or higher bonuses and final pay-outs.

- There is a risk that the proposed distribution channels are inappropriate to the market resulting in lower sales, especially since the company has no experience in the lower income market.

- There may be mis-selling by intermediaries resulting in higher withdrawal rates and reputational risk for the insurer.

- This risk is exacerbated due to the target market being a lower income market, which might be financially unsophisticated.

- The company's marketing might be inappropriate for a lower income market. Administration / Systems issues:

- The insurer's IT systems may not be able to cope with the administration of this product. Legal, regulatory or fiscal developments:

- Regulatory changes may impact on the investment returns and costs of the business, e.g. changes to the investment limitations for insurers may force the insurer to invest in assets producing lower returns and impact on the insurer's ability to meet PRE.

- The fiscal environment may change removing any tax advantages impacting on the popularity of the product.

- Decisions of the courts could impact on minimum bonus declarations or limit the use of MVR in practice. Part (i) was fairly well answered by most candidates. Some candidates claimed the structure was simple, however it is unlikely that a unitised with-profits policy with surrender penalties and a market value reduction could be described as simple compared to some of the other investment avenues open (e.g. a fixed deposit). Some candidates did not give sufficient detail for an "outline" question. Part (ii) was reasonably well answered by most candidates. Marks were lost by candidates in respect of things such as:

- Giving answers which were too brief, for example making suggestions such as "regulatory changes" without explaining why these could pose a risk in this case.

- Several candidates referred to "the guarantee" without explaining what the guarantee was.

- Some candidates outlined factors to consider in contract design instead of focusing on the risks as required.

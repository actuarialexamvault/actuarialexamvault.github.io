## QUESTION 5

Suitability of changes:

- Client needs:

- The early surrender values will be improved due to the removal of surrender penalties.

- This may meet policyholder's expectations of a return of premium at early durations.

- However, this will be at the expense of relatively poorer surrender values for those that surrender later (due to the higher charges they will have paid).

- The refund of product charges, means that maturities are unaffected by the removal of the surrender penalty.

- However, surrender shortly before maturity will not receive the refund, which will not meet policyholder expectations as it results in a discrepancy between surrender and maturity values.

- Marketability:

- The lack of a surrender penalty may appear marketable.

- However, the higher product charges may make the product less marketable.

- Reduced commission makes the product less marketable to advisors.

- Competitiveness:

- The removal of the surrender penalty will apply to all insurance companies, so should not affect the competitiveness of the product.

- Product charges may become relatively more important from a competitive perspective:

- Particularly relative to products offered by other financial institutions (such as unit trust companies or banks).

- This might result in the increased fund management charge being very unattractive to the market.

- Or other product features may now become a competitive advantage (e.g. the refund of charges on maturity).

- Product risks:

- Because there is no surrender penalty, the product is now more sensitive to the lapse rate experience.

- This increased riskiness could result in the company being required to increase the risk discount rate in line with the increased required return for shareholders.

- This may result in more conservative pricing assumptions.

- The regular commission may incentivise the sales force to service the policyholders better, which may improve persistency.

- Financing requirements:

- Lower upfront commission reduces the new business strain.

- However, because there is no surrender penalty, the surrender strain on lapses will increase.

- Profitability:

- Due to increased competitiveness in the market in terms of charges, there is likely to be a reduction in the profitability.

- Sensitivity of profit:

- More sensitive to withdrawal rates in particular - covered earlier.

- Practical Considerations:

- Administration systems will have to be changed.

- The changes will need to be communicated to the sales force, administrators, etc.

- All of these changes incur costs, which need to be recouped.

- Consistency with existing products:

- If the company has any other products affected by the regulations then it is important to check that the changes to the 10 year product are consistent with the changes made to the other products affected by the regulations. Overall, this question was not well answered. Some of the common mistakes included:

- Not reading that it was a 10-year term, which led to mistakes about the total commission paid, etc.

- Referring to the "premium" and the "price", suggesting that candidates did not understand that the increase in fees from 2% to 4% was the "price".

- Commenting in detail on underwriting, indicating a lack of understanding as to how savings products work.

- Failing to mention that higher risks would result in an increased return requirement from the shareholders.

## QUESTION 6

i. The general approach to setting surrender values is to consider the following values:

- Asset share:

- The company would not want to pay more than the asset share on average over a reasonable period of time.

- However, basing the surrender value on the asset share means that the company will not make a profit on surrender.

- At very early durations:

- the asset share is negative because initial expenses have not been recovered; and

- the company cannot avoid losses on surrenders (even if no surrender value is offered at these durations).

- Prospective reserve:

- If the surrender value is based on a prospective reserve, calculated using the original premium basis, then the company broadly retains profits accrued up to the surrender date.

- Basing the surrender value on the prospective realistic reserve allows the company to capitalise all the profits it is expecting to make on the contract, both past and future.

- However, capitalising future profits may be considered too unfair to surrendering policyholders, so a basis between the realistic basis and the premium basis may be preferred.

- One significant disadvantage of using the prospective reserve is that it is very sensitive to future assumptions, in particular the interest rate assumption.

- It is common to use retrospective values at early durations, blending into prospective values at later durations.

- Surrender administration expenses:

- The company will want to be sure that the cost of administering the surrender is borne by the surrendering policyholder and not by the company or by other policyholders.

- General considerations:

- Surrender values should meet policyholder reasonable expectations, which include:

- For surrenders near maturity, surrender values that are in line with the maturity value.

- For surrenders at early durations, surrender values that are comparable to premiums paid.

- The surrender values should maintain fairness between:

- Policyholders leaving and staying; and

- Policyholders and shareholders, the latter would require a reasonable contribution to profit.

- Need to ensure that surrender values are consistent with paid-up values and comparable to auction values, if they exist.

- Surrender values should:

- Not encourage selection against the company, including lapse and reentry.

- Be comparable to values offered by competitors.

- Comply with any regulatory requirements.

- Progress relatively smoothly over duration and scales should not change frequently (over time).

This could potentially be addressed by:

- Reducing existing surrender values (possibly to zero) at early durations (if regulation allows).

- This may, in addition, change the surrender behaviour of policyholders (reducing surrenders).

- Increasing the cross-subsidies between late surrenders and early surrenders.

- The existing surrender experience could be useful to assess the extent of the cross-subsidy required.

- However, this will reduce the surrender values at later durations, possibly resulting in policyholder dissatisfaction. It is unlikely that the insurer will be able to change the surrender values for existing policies, due to:

- explicit surrender terms in the contract; or

- the risk of negative publicity. It is therefore likely the surrender values will only be changed for new business (subject to regulation and competitive considerations).

ii. Interest:

- The expected returns on securities backing the liabilities will be the best estimate assumption.

- Consider the interest rate used in the premium basis if the company wishes to use a blended basis. Expenses:

- The most recent expense investigation will be used.

- Only renewal expenses and claim expenses will be included.

- The company is unlikely to add margins since this would increase surrender values.

- Allow for renewal commission as paid.

- Allow for the expenses incurred in surrendering the policy. Inflation:

- Should be chosen to be consistent with the investment return assumption.

- The company may need both a price-inflation and an earnings-inflation assumption.

Mortality:

- The basis chosen should reflect the expected future mortality of the surrendering policyholders.

- Since there is a guaranteed death benefit under endowment assurances it is reasonable to assume that surrendering policyholders would experience lighter mortality than those who do not surrender (for protection policies).

- The company could make an explicit allowance for lighter mortality.

- Select mortality could be used (although the nature of the selective process is not the same as that of the underlying standard table).

- Alternatively, the company could use unadjusted mortality experience and rely on other margins in the basis for differences in the mortality between those who surrender and policyholders who remain in force. Part (i) was a relatively easy question if candidates knew the theory well. The most common mistake was to not explicitly address both parts of the question, in particular what the company could do to address the losses on early surrenders. Where candidates suggested an approach, it was often too generic (e.g. "use the retrospective method early on and then move to the prospective method at later durations"). A surprisingly large number of candidates also seem to confuse a surrender value on a conventional without profit product with a surrender penalty levied on unit-linked contracts (or use the two terms interchangeably). In part (ii), a large number of candidates discussed general considerations when setting assumptions instead of tailoring their answer for the scenario of setting the basis for surrender values Some candidates also suggested that initial expenses will be included in the prospective reserve, showing a lack of basic reserving knowledge.

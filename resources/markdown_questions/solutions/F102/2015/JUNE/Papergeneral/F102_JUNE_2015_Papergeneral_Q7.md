## QUESTION 7

i. A reinsurer could provide assistance in the following areas:

- Technical assistance:

- This will be needed because the mutual is small and therefore will likely have limited resources.

- You are also new in the job and newly qualified and therefore might not have sufficient knowledge and experience in your area of responsibility and therefore getting outside assistance will be necessary.

- It is a new product line and the mutual is unlikely to have sufficient experience to price the product.

- It is an online proposition and you will need assistance with the underwriting question set and possibly access to an automated underwriting system which the reinsurer should be able to make available.

- Capital requirements:

- Risk transfer:

- The mutual is small and in a new market and will want to be cautious about how much risk to take on. Therefore it will most likely want to reinsure with a large % quota share ideally with a profit share to the insurer.

ii. Underwriting:

- Because the product is offered through the internet you would ideally like the underwriting questions to be part of the application and at the end of the application process an 'accept, reject or loading decision' to be given.

- You would want only a small proportion of cases to be referred for further medical evidence as it is likely that the inconvenience of going for medicals or blood tests would be a deterrent to sales.

- You would want to ask lifestyle underwriting questions such as occupation, pursuits and residence as you would probably also use these as rating factors.

- Minimal financial underwriting would be sensible which probably can be achieved by limiting the maximum sum assured that is offered.

- Strict claims management processes would be essential to ensure that there was no non-disclosure at the time of application.

iii. Pricing would differ as follows:

- No experience will be available on this product as it is new, however you could use the underlying experience from the without-profit term assurance sold through the salesforce and then make adjustments to it.

- It is likely that a higher price would be needed for the new product to allow for reduced underwriting and therefore possibly greater anti-selection leading to worsening underlying experience.

- However, reduced underwriting means lower expenses on underwriting which means a lower allowance for expenses and therefore a lower price. The point above though is likely to outweigh this reduction.

- The increased claims underwriting will increase expenses.

- No commission will be paid to a salesforce which should result in a lower price. However, the cost of setting up the systems for the direct offering will need to be recouped and will push the price up.

- Withdrawals are likely to be higher for the direct product (as sales advised products should better meet the needs of policyholders) and so initial costs would need to be recouped quicker pushing up the price. (It could, however, also be argued that as the policyholder initiates the purchase withdrawals may be lower while less likely in practice credit was given if this point was argued clearly.)

- Overall you would expect higher mortality costs but lower expenses but the overall result is likely to be a higher overall cost for the product than the one sold through the salesforce.

In part (i) many candidates just gave the generic ways a reinsurer can help an insurer without considering the specifics given in the question, e.g. small insurer, new distribution channel, newly qualified actuary, all of which should have influenced the answers: In part (ii), once again, many candidates just reproduced the general items from the notes without taking into consideration the distribution channel the mutual wants to use (the internet). You will not make many sales on the internet if you are going to ask people to go for medical tests or doctors' appointments. Many candidates also missed the fact that if you underwrite less up front then you need to be more stringent in your claims underwriting.
The answers to part (iii) were generally quite poor, with only a few candidates considering all aspects of pricing. Very few candidates stated that the insurer could use the experience from their existing product and then adjust it for changes needed. A number of candidates took the approach of mentioning which items would differ (e.g. expenses, mortality etc.) but then failed to say which would be higher or which lower in each case and why that would be the case. This is a display of very poor critical thinking and exam technique. Many candidates did not demonstrate clear thinking when considering the likely withdrawal experience of the internet-sold policies.

## QUESTION 8

i. Main reasons for holding free assets:

- The main reason is to ensure that policyholder obligations are met even if future experience is worse than expected and actual liabilities are higher than the current expected level.

- A minimum level will probably be required by the regulator.

- Finance future new business strain.

- Enable less reinsurance to be purchased.

- Enable a less restrictive investment strategy to enhance expected returns.

- Support management strategies e.g. business acquisitions in specific areas or take advantage of other profitable opportunities as they present themselves.

- Smooth dividend payments to shareholders.

- Smooth surplus distribution and thus support policyholder expectations.

- Provide confidence to policyholders, shareholders and brokers.

- Improve credit ratings and thus reduce debt finance costs.

ii. Dynamic solvency testing (DST) is the projection of the company's revenue account and
balance sheet (and thus solvency level) for a specified future period.
The projection could be done deterministically or stochastically. If deterministic, the projection basis should include possible adverse scenarios.

The benefits of DST are:

- To assess how well the company can withstand variations in both economic elements of experience as well as demographic adverse future experience, which cannot be appreciated with a static solvency test.

- This insurer is growing rapidly, and will require significant capital to finance new business strain. DST will demonstrate whether there is a risk of insolvency given new business growth scenarios.

- To assess the impact on solvency of any other decisions, e.g. business acquisitions, reinsurance changes and investment strategy.

- Depending on the type of product and level of guarantees being sold, the insurer can assess its risk of insolvency as a result of adverse experience on items being guaranteed e.g. mortality or investment.

- DST will thus allow management to take corrective action before solvency deteriorates to an unacceptable level.

iii. Considerations in investing the free assets:

- The main consideration would be to maximise the investment return on free assets, subject to the risk tolerance of the company.

- The need to finance new business strain. This will lead to a greater holding of cash and other stable and liquid assets.

- The results of the DST in combination with management risk tolerance: if the DST shows an unacceptably high probability of insolvency at some future point, this may lead to some risk reduction, including a less aggressive investment strategy.

- The nature, term and currency of the liabilities and whether the liabilities have been matched. If they have been matched, it allows the free assets to be invested more aggressively for a higher expected return.

- Policyholder expectations for smoothed bonuses: the less the need to smooth bonuses using free reserves, the greater the investment freedom for the free assets.

- Excess over regulator minimum requirement: A large excess will allow a more aggressive investment strategy.

- Size of the free assets will determine the extent to which investment can occur in certain asset classes such as direct property.

involved, but the answers produced suggested a point-in-time exercise, rather than a future projection.
Part (iii) was very disappointing, with a number of candidates producing points relating to the investment of reserves rather than free assets. A number of candidates thought that dayto-day expenses and claims are payable from free reserves, however liabilities (and corresponding assets) are specifically held for this purpose. A large number of candidates provided a list of considerations (e.g. "size of free assets" or "business plans") without outlining and explaining the impact of the factor listed on investments.

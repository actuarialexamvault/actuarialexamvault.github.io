## QUESTION 1

i.
Factors to consider:

- Price of the reinsurance, including reinsurance commissions, any financing commission offered and whether a profit share is offered or not.

- Experience of the reinsurer with respect to critical illness business and any technical assistance available from the reinsurer.

- Credit rating of the reinsurer and strength of the financial position of the reinsurer.

- Treaty terms being offered, including items such as automatic acceptance limits, benefit maximums, etc.

- Financial reinsurance support that might be available (e.g. nil premium payment period).

- Current relationship with the reinsurer including how much business the insurer currently reinsure with the reinsurer.

- Cost of solvency requirements, if the risk is retained, vs cost of reinsurance. ii. Assumptions to consider:

- Mortality assumptions: both the base mortality and future likely improvements should be considered. These are key assumptions in the pricing.

- Morbidity assumptions: both the base morbidity (critical illness) and future likely improvements/deteriorations would need to be reviewed.

- Investment return/risk discount rate: if the reinsurance structure is a level premium reinsurance structure this could have a significant impact on the rates.

- Lapses/withdrawals: the reinsurance structure would influence whether this is important as an assumption. It would be important for level premium structures but not important for risk premium reinsurance.

- Margins: what level of margin is allowed for and how it is allowed (eg. is there an uncertainty allowance on each parameter or overall on the final price).

- Options and guarantees: are there options/guarantees being priced for and how do they impact the final pricing. Examiners' comments For part (i) a number a candidates missed straight forward bookwork points. A number of candidates failed to answer the question, giving more points on why in insurer would obtain reinsurance, rather than focusing on factors that an insurer would consider when selecting a reinsurer. For part (ii) many candidates gave repetitive points on the reasons for pricing assumptions being too high and actions the insurer could take to reduce assumptions, which was not asked in the question. Few candidates considered the importance of each assumption to pricing critical illness reinsurance and discussed how to allow for possible future changes in experience for individual assumptions.

## QUESTION 7

i.
The investments selected should be appropriate to the nature, term and currency of the liabilities. The extent to which the appropriate investments referred to above may be departed from in order to maximise the overall return will depend, inter alia, on the extent of the company's free assets/risk appetite.
The part of the benefit in the form of the basic sum assured and existing declared bonuses is guaranteed in nature. These benefits are best matched by bonds/fixed interest securities (government or corporate bonds).
Part of the benefit (future bonuses) will be discretionary. The insurer will aim to maximise the discretionary benefits (i.e. maximise returns), but this would be subject to the expectations of policyholders and their attitude to risk. Policyholders will usually expect the proceeds of their contracts to maintain their value in "real" terms. Hence the assets should be those that are expected to provide a "real" return (equities and property).
Part of the expected future outflows relating to this business will be expenses, which are likely to be linked to an inflation index (index-linked bonds).
But assets selected will depend on:

- The bonus philosophy of the insurer (split between reversionary and terminal bonuses).

- Policyholder expectations of smoothing of bonuses/company's smoothing philosophy

ii.
The effect of the change in investment strategy:

- The proposed investment strategy is moving away from risky assets into lower risk assets.

- The insurer will earn higher running yields on underlying investments (more certain sources of profits). In addition returns on portfolio slightly smoother, but lower in long run.

- The insurer could increase the reversionary bonus component and decrease terminal bonus. But should consider current levels of bonus compared to running yields and determine if there is scope for increase.

- The change in the investment strategy might improve the matched position of the insurer. The change might have been necessary due to high proportion of guaranteed liabilities on book.

- The insurer may decide not to change bonus distribution strategy at all. The new proposal may be a better match for the existing strategy and change is just bringing the investment and bonus distribution strategy in line with each other.

- In either case the insurer will need to consider whether the bonus distribution strategy be sustained with the new asset mix and expected returns on these assets. Factors to consider around the bonus distribution strategy:

- The decision will be affected by policyholders' reasonable expectations and extent of the change.

- Communications to policyholders around the bonus distribution philosophy whether the new investment strategy is in line with this.

- The effect on the competitive position/marketability of the insurer.

- Implications for the solvency position of the insurer. The insurer may want to keep reversionary bonuses low to keep guarantees low to improve the solvency position of the insurer.

- The insurer will need to decide whether to implement the change the bonus philosophy for new business only or also for existing business

- The insurer should consider equity between different generations of policyholders e.g. if current funding level is high, then unfair to be for undistributed funds to be distributed to policyholders who did not help to contribute to funds.

- Consider whether a special reversionary bonus should be declared before the change, based on funding level or current level of retained profit. Other factors to consider

- Reasons for lower risk investment strategy.

- Consistency with overall business strategy e.g. efficient use of capital or shareholders required rate of return.

- Capital requirements may change due to the lower risk investment strategy; it is likely that less solvency capital will be required.

- Potential impact on profit.

- Costs of implementing the change e.g. disinvesting and re-investing.

iii.
Advantages for the policyholder:

- The cash bonus is received earlier than on the insured event.

- May meet the need for income e.g. repayment of loan.

- Less subjective decisions (less discretion on bonus to be declared), which protects policyholders against ungenerous companies.

- The bonus may appear fairer/more equitable if contribution method is used (where the bonus distribution is related to the contribution to the total profit of each of expense, mortality and investment profit for the group of policies).

- May be tax advantages/disadvantages depending on how cash dividends are taxed vs bonuses on final payout. Disadvantages for the policyholder:

- This method may not be preferred if policyholder's intention is to save and ensure savings keep up with inflation.

- The returns may be reduced due to non-deferral of surplus as with the terminal bonus structure.

- Reinvestment risk for the policyholder if they want to save the bonuses till maturity date. Advantage for the company:

- Marketing - the policyholder may more easily understand the basis, hence more sales.

- Marketing - policyholders may like the certainty of receiving benefit earlier rather than later, hence more sales.

- Possibly lower withdrawals because policyholders get cash in hand regularly. Disadvantages for the company:

- Constraints on investment policy due to no deferral of bonus payment.

- No ability to use deferred profits as margins against adverse experience.

- Reduces the contribution to free assets to enable writing of new business as in case of deferred method.

- Reduces funds under management.

- Increased administration compared to other methods because of annual payment.

- Requires complex calculations.

- May be competitive disadvantage if customers do not understand the product because they are more familiar with the other method. Part (i) was answered reasonably well except where students went into too much detail about the types of assets to invest in and not the factors to consider for with-profits products specifically. A few students didn't know what UK style with-profits business was, even though in the third part of the question it was explained! Part (ii) was poorly answered. Not enough points were made, and only one or two students mentioned that the new assets could be matching the current bonus strategy better or at least the importance of considering current levels of matching to decide if bonus philosophy needed to change. Part (iii) was reasonably well answered. Be careful not to mention advantage for one as disadvantage for another, because the point will only be scored once.

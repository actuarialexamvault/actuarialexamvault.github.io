## QUESTION 1

Advantages for the insurer:

- New business strain can be reduced under UWP through product design.

- E.g. higher initial charges.

- Reviewable charges are more acceptable.

- Low (or no) guarantees are more acceptable.

- Easier to understand, which could lead to more new business.

- New PRE can be created by wording marketing material differently.

- Might bring product offering more in line with that of competitors. Disadvantages for the insurer:

- Will require a new administration system.

- Will require significant marketing and training costs.

- More expensive to administer.

- There is a business risk as the insurer doesn't have experience in writing this class of business.

- The product is similar in structure to unit-linked life insurance business and unit trust business, which means there are more companies to compete against

- Will need expertise in managing the CWP closed fund bonuses.

- There could be negative perceptions created for CWP policyholders/negative impact because it is a closed fund, e.g. if in deficit.

- Reversionary bonuses tend to have a higher cost of bonus in the early years.

- This results in less deferral of surplus and potentially lower level of free assets which reduces investment freedom. Advantages for the policyholder:

- The UWP product is easier to understand due to:

- charges being explicit; and

- bonuses related to the value of units.

- UWP is arguably more equitable as companies tend to hold back less surplus.

- Might be more flexible e.g. switch to unit linked allowed.

- It might be advantageous to existing CWP policyholders, if the fund is in surplus, not to have to share this surplus with new policyholders. Disadvantages for the policyholder:

- Less smoothing takes place as companies tend to hold back less surplus.

- Could lead to reduced returns, due to less deferral of profits.

- Charges are not always guaranteed.

- If death occurs early in the policy the benefit received may be less than it would have been had a CWP policy been effected.

The majority of candidates confused a unitised with-profit contract with a unit-linked contract. Whilst unitised with-profit contracts look and operate like a unit-linked contract, the company determines the price of the units, the company has discretion over the bonuses granted and there is no direct link to a specified pool of assets on unitised with-profit business. In addition, candidates focused primarily on the differences between the two products and did not generate enough points relating to the business impact side of the decision e.g. might require a new administration system and can create new PRE.

## QUESTION 2

i. Benefits provided and policyholder needs met by the product:

- A lump sum is payable where the policyholder suffers from one of the covered conditions, in particular the benefit is payable:

- On the happening of an event, e.g. stroke.

- On reaching a defined degree of impairment.

- On undergoing a surgical procedure.

- The sum insured is selected upfront by the policyholder, and thus the product is not designed to indemnify the policyholder.

- It can be useful in helping to offset the cost of medical care or AIDS, e.g. purchasing a wheelchair.

- The lump sum can be used to purchase an impaired life annuity to replace lost income and/or higher ongoing costs (e.g. nursing care) and lifestyle changes.

- In the event of no CI claim, the policyholder will receive a lump sum at maturity, surrender or death, and hence the policy meets a need for savings.

- It can be used by partners to fund the buyout of a stake in a partnership when a partner is diagnosed with CI and is no longer able to continue working.

ii. The investment risks to the insurer:

- Poor investment returns on the unit fund relative to the prudent assumption in setting the premium rate, leading to:

- Lower than expected unit-linked charges resulting in non-recovery of expenses.

- Higher than expected CI risk charges, which further reduces the unit fund.

- Lower than expected surrender/death/maturity benefits and disappointed policyholders (with possible reputational damage to the insurer).

- Poor unit-linked investment returns relative to competitors, resulting in reputational damage to the insurer.

These risks can be mitigated as follows:

- Limit fund choice to exclude funds that can be very volatile and therefor at higher risk of poor performance. Funds that are adequately diversified across asset classes and geographic regions might be most appropriate.

- Adequate information provided at sale of the policy to enable the policyholder to understand the risk/return profile of various investment funds.

- Regular updates on fund performance to enable policyholders to switch to less risky funds as soon as they realise their risk appetites are not consistent with the funds they are invested in.

- Actuarial funding could remove the investment risk associated with recoupment of initial expenses, if this is permitted and provided regular charges are expected to be sufficient to do this.

- Do not offer a unit-linked product, but sell only a without-profit CI product.

iii. Additional risk to the insurer:

- There will be additional costs if the unit fund is below the guaranteed fund at time of claim.

- The magnitude of this risk depends on the volatility of the assets in the unit fund: more volatile assets such as equity are expected to increase the riskiness.

- The risk is increased if policyholders have the ability to switch their investment types during the policy term.

- The risk of a shortfall can be managed by matching and/or additional charges.

- As policyholders can choose investment funds, matching sufficient assets to the guaranteed liability is not straightforward:

- This requires that fund choice be limited to those that include assets that provide a suitable match for the guarantee.

- However, this will be very restrictive to policyholders and might result in poor sales volumes.

- The guarantee is a fixed rate, which is matched by fixed interest stocks.

- Fixed interest stocks should be priced to yield a return of expected inflation plus real return plus an inflation risk premium, so it should be possible to match the 3% p.a. guarantee.

- Matching won't eliminate all risks due to unknown timing of death benefits. This risk reduces for bigger pools, however for this insurer this may take some time, since this is a new product feature.

- Instead of restricting the fund choice it may be possible to hedge the guarantee by using put options on assets similar to those underlying the investment fund.

- Pricing for the risk and introducing a charge for this benefit:

- There is greater complexity in pricing and the risk of mis-pricing.

- The cost of providing the guarantee might make the premium rate and product unattractive leading to poor sales.

- The charge might differ significantly between policyholders, depending on the riskiness of the underlying unit fund.

- This further increases the complexity of pricing and administering this business.

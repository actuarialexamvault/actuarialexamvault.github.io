## QUESTION 3

i. Risk factors:

- Type of illness

- Age

- Sex

- Duration from entry / Duration in force

- Smoker status

- Medical status

- Source of business

- Income / Socio-economic class

ii. Discussion of manager's statements:

- Removing this product from the claim investigation will definitely lead to time savings.

- However, the savings might not be as significant as the manager expects, since the claim experience investigations for all the other products still need to be performed.

- Since the business is 100% reinsured the company's exposure to critical illness risk is significantly reduced and, hence, the investigation results are less important to the company.

- However, there are still many reasons why the investigation adds value to the company.

- Even though its exposure to critical illness risk is reduced significantly, it is still exposed to residual critical illness risk. For example:

- The insurer is still liable to policyholders for claim payments, so if the reinsurer defaults, it will be fully exposed to the disability risk on this book of business.

- If the reinsurance premiums are reviewable then the reinsurer can increase these premiums in response to a worsening in claims experience.

- The above means that the company's management needs to understand its critical illness risk exposure, and the claim investigation provides information on this.

- Going forward the company might plan to reduce the reinsurance on this business, which would increase its disability risk and increase the importance of the claim experience investigation.

- The company might be in the process of reducing its reliance on the technical expertise of the reinsurer and hence needs to continue performing these claim experience investigations.

- A claim investigation assesses the validity of the claim rates on critical illness products, which are required for the following purposes:

- Reserve calculations

- Product pricing

- The claim investigation will inform the company whether the current reinsurance agreement is too costly to the direct writer.

- It will also provide information to the direct writer regarding the volatility of its critical illness claims experience.

- This information can be used to negotiate lower reinsurance premiums with the existing reinsurer.

- This information can also be used to assess the current reinsurance strategy.

- For example, if the claims volatility is acceptably low the company might realise that it is no longer necessary to reinsure 100% of the business.

- A comparison of actual and expected critical illness claim rates might be required by the regulator.

- The critical illness rates on these products might be used to assist in the pricing of other critical illness products.

- An analysis of the type of illnesses leading to critical illness claims can be very useful information for product design purposes.

- For example, illnesses which trigger very few claims might be replaced by illnesses that are more common and hence meet policyholder needs better. Part (i) was generally well handled by candidates. Many candidates scored full marks or close to full marks for this straightforward part. Part (ii) was incredibly poorly handled. The common issues were as follows:

- Many candidates failed to agree that not doing the experience study would save time and thereby lost easy marks. Probably only 10-15% of candidates acknowledged this point.

- Many candidates (at least 25%) suggested that even though the reinsurance was in place at 100% the company still retained substantial morbidity risk, and went on to explain (wrongly) how that could be true. It seemed as though candidates invented their own question to answer because they didn't like the question they were asked.

- Answers were generally far too thin. Candidates often got one or two points but very few candidates gave a sufficiently comprehensive answer to warrant passing the question.

- Many candidates raised points that just weren't relevant such as asset shares, mortality rates. Many candidates also made assumptions about the question so that they could answer what they wanted to answer rather than what the question asked.

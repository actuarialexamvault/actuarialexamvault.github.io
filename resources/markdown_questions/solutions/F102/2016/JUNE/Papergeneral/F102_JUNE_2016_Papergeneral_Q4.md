## QUESTION 4

i. Reasons:

- In general mortality rates applicable to lower socio-economic classes are higher than the mortality rates of the mid- to high-income market (e.g. due to factors such as access to medical care, nutrition, etc.

- Annuity payments are made until death. Therefore relatively fewer payments are expected to be made to lives from the low income market, which then crosssubsidises the higher cost of the expected benefit payments to the mid- to higherincome market.

- Also, immediate annuity markets tend to be dominated by mid- to higher-income individuals, resulting in single premium rates being weighted towards the lighter mortality of higher socio-economic classes.

ii. Factors to consider:

- Cross-subsidy

- Currently there is a cross-subsidy between socio-economic groups. The new product will remove (or at least reduce) that cross-subsidy.

- This could lead to an increase in price for the higher income classes.

- However, it is possible that historically the lower socio-economic classes did not buy this product and therefore average mortality experience already reflects the mortality experience of the mid/high socio-economic classes.

- Therefore the impact on price for the mid/high income classes may be small.

- Client needs

- Arguably this will be a better match to client needs because the product offers better value for money.

- Some clients may now have access to a product that previously may have been too expensive.

- Consistency with existing business

- It is probable that existing products will not have surrender values, in which case lapse and re-entry risks do not have to be considered.

- Low income policyholders, who have recently purchased an annuity, may be unhappy that they paid more for the same annuity.

- The actuary will have to consider the impact of this product on the price of new business (only).

- Marketability

- The actuary may have to consider whether the product features, such as inflation-linked benefit payments, are attractive to the low income market.

- Attractiveness may be different than in the mid/high-income market.

- The actuary must also consider whether the current distribution channel is appropriate for the lower socio-economic class (e.g. direct distribution may be considered).

- Competitiveness

- The annuity product should be competitive compared to the specialist annuity writer including:

- A competitive price.

- Underwriting requirements, e.g. how socio-economic class is determined/ assessed.

- Product features, e.g. guarantee period.

- Commission.

- Product risks

- Mortality is a significant risk.

- In particular, improvements in mortality.

- It is unlikely that the company has significant annuity experience in the low socio-economic market.

- It may be relatively more complicated to project improvement for the low socio-economic class.

- e.g. Improving access to free health care may have relatively larger impact in the lower socio-economic classes.

- Investment risk

- Given that a single premium is paid up-front, reinvestment risk is probably limited. Unless there is a shortage of appropriately termed bonds0

- For the low-income market, the discounted mean term of liabilities is likely to be shorter, therefore it is more likely to find bonds to match.

- Product mix risk

- The company may decide to allocate more of the overhead expenses to the annuity of the higher socio-economic class.

- This leads to business-mix risk if the4 mix of business differs from what was assumed.

- Other risks depend on product features

- E.g. if there is some guaranteed increase in annuity payments, that may be difficult to match with an appropriate asset.

- The company may consider the use of reinsurance to manage some of these risks.

- Financing requirements

- Working capital is not likely to be a significant issue, because this is a single premium contract

- Would be able to match initial expenses such as commission.

- There may be solvency capital requirements, however, given the guaranteed nature of the product.

- Onerousness of guarantees

- The company guarantees an income for life, without the ability to reprice. This will be very onerous.

- Margins would be required in pricing.

- Profitability

- Sensitivity of profit

- Likely to be sensitive to the:

- mortality experience; and

- investment experience.

- Administration

- Unlikely to have a major impact, given that the company is already able to administer annuity products.

- Regulatory requirement

- This is unlikely to be a significant concern, although restrictions such as maximum fees or minimum annuity rates should be investigated.

- Tax

- This is unlikely to be a major concern, as the product is likely to be taxed similarly to the existing annuity product.

- Other markets

- Such products might be well established in foreign markets and the lessons learnt in those markets should be researched. The majority of candidates scored well on part (i). The marks for part (ii) were reasonable, in general. The most common mistakes included:

- Suggesting that the longevity risk (i.e. the risk that a policyholder lives longer than expected) is necessarily lower for the low socio-economic class because (the absolute) mortality rates are likely to be higher.

- Not knowing the features of an immediate annuity product, e.g. some candidates suggested that there is a lapse-and-re-entry risk, without indicating that this is only a risk IF there is a surrender benefit - which is unlikely.

- Not understanding that "introducing a rating factor", means that the actuary should specify the product design for all the "levels" of the rating factor. Some candidates only considered the design in respect of "low socio-economic" lives.

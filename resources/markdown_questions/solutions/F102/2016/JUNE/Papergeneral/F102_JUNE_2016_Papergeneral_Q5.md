## QUESTION 5

Considerations:

- The company should check that the alteration is supportable by the asset share (i.e. the policy value does not exceed the asset share) at the alteration date in order to avoid making a loss.

- The difference between the asset share and the policy value before alteration (calculated on the current premium basis) represents the "accrued" profit for the period up to the date of alteration that will be extracted by the company.

- Use of the current premium basis to determine the policy value after the alteration will give the expected profit over the remaining life of the contract corresponding with that from current new policies.

- The calculation of the present value of the policy after the alteration should be adjusted for initial expenses and commission (which are not payable in the case of an altered policy).

- If this is not done the terms may be too harsh.

- Similarly, the alteration expenses should be deducted from the policy value before the alteration (or added to the policy value after the alteration).

- If this is not done the terms may be too generous.

- The company should consider the risk of anti-selection by policyholders.

- Under the new contract, the sum assured will be paid out at either the same time as before (if death occurs before the original maturity date) or later (on survival beyond the original maturity date), which means that either:

- the revised premium should be lower than before, or

- if the premium stays the same, the sum assured should be increased.

- Those in very poor health would gain by extending the term of their policy, because they would be paying a lower premium and expect to receive the benefit at the same time as before.

- To deal with this selection risk, the company could:

- require a declaration of continuing good health;

- restrict the conditions on which this alteration can be performed, for example, link it to a life event such as the birth of a child;

- underwrite alterations and modify the terms offered if necessary; or

- use a basis with higher mortality than in the premium basis to calculate the policy value after the alteration, for all alterations.

- Use of the current premium basis will ensure consistency between the terms offered on alterations and new policies.

- This will help to avoid potential problems with lapse and re-entry (where policy values before alteration are positive).

- The company will also consider whether the premium, using the alteration basis, is less than the premium the policyholder would pay if he/she lapses the existing policy and uses the surrender value, if any, to subsidise the premium on a new policy with an extended term.

- Using the same basis for the present values before and after the alteration will make the method stable, i.e. a small increase in term will result in only a small increase in premium.

- The company will have to consider alteration terms used by competitors. This may affect policyholders' reasonable expectations.

- The alteration basis is unlikely to change very often, because it is dependent on the current premium basis, which generally does not change frequently in practice.

- The alteration basis:

- Should be relatively easy to administer, because the existing premium basis is readily available.

- Could be difficult to explain to policyholders, who are unlikely to be familiar with present value calculations.

- Should be relatively easy to document.

This was a challenging question and most candidates struggled. Candidates that did well on this question were able to accurately describe the profit that will be extracted using this basis, identify the selection risks that the company should consider and apply the theory (e.g. by indicating that because the same basis is used to calculate the policy values before and after the alteration, a small increase in the product term, will result in a small change in the premium).

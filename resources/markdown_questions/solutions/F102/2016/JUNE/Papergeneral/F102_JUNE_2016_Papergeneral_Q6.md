## QUESTION 6

i. Market-consistent methodology:

- A market-consistent approach to the valuation of provisions for policyholder liabilities implies that policyholder liabilities and assets are valued at market value.

- A market-consistent value of a liability is the price that someone would charge for taking ownership of the liability, in a market in which such liabilities are freely traded.

- Such markets for insurance liabilities seldom exist in practice so an approximate approach has to be taken.

- Future parameter values and cashflows are set so as to be consistent with market values, where a corresponding market exists.

- E.g. valuing the cashflows from an immediate without-profits annuity as a series of zero coupon bonds with maturities corresponding with the timing of the cashflows from the annuity.

- The value of the liabilities can be determined:

- as the current market price of a portfolio of assets that exactly replicates the liabilities; or

- by discounting the cashflows at current risk-free rates of interest.

- Risk-free rates may be determined based on government bond yields or on swap rates (if there is a sufficiently deep and liquid market).

- If the risk-free rate is derived from corporate bonds it may be appropriate to make a deduction to allow for credit risk.

- Allowance for an illiquidity premium may be permitted for long-term predictable liabilities for which matching assets can be held to maturity.

- It is likely to be difficult to obtain market consistent assumptions for certain elements of the basis (e.g. demographic and expense assumptions).

- These assumptions would be determined on a best-estimate basis including a risk margin.

- The risk margin reflects the compensation required by the market in return for taking on those uncertain aspects of the liability cashflows.

- This could be related to each assumption or overall using the cost of capital approach.

- The overall risk margin using the cost of capital approach is:

- multiplied by the cost of capital (frictional cost of locking in this capital to earn risk free rate rather than invest it freely to earn a higher reward) discounted at market consistent rates.

- The complexity of the exercise to project future capital requirements depends on the complexity of the capital calculations required by the regulator. Simplified approaches may be used.

ii. Minimum solvency margin:

- The minimum solvency margin provides an additional level of protection to the policyholders over and above that provided by the provisions alone.

- The objective is to reduce the likelihood of the insurance companies becoming insolvent in even in extreme (1 in 200 year events) circumstances.

- When considering the adequacy of the provisions that have been set up it is important to do this in the context of the solvency margin (and vice versa).

- The overall security of the financial position of the insurer is the combination of these two items.

- A solvency regime may have a weaker (e.g. best-estimate) basis for provisioning for policyholder liabilities and a more stringent solvency margin (and vice versa).

iii. Explanation:

- The aggregated solvency margin should be reduced to reflect any diversification benefits that exist between the individual risks ie the degree to which individual risks are correlated.

- This is because it is unlikely that the investment and mortality shocks will happen at the same time.

- Diversification benefits can be allowed for through the use of correlation matrices (but under the extreme event conditions being tested, correlations may differ from those observed under normal conditions).

- This could be allowed for by using copulas.

- However, the solvency margin calculated using a correlation matrix may be too low due to the effects of non-linearity and non-separability of individual risks.

- The linearity property of correlation matrices requires that the solvency margin required is a linear function of the risk drivers, but in practice these relationships can be non-linear (e.g. effects of investment guarantees biting).

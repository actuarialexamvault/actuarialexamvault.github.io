## QUESTION 7

i. Underwriting of the individual life product compared to the group product:

- The group underwriting will use an "actively at work" requirement.

- Under group business most of the individuals will be under the Free Cover Limit, and hence will not be underwritten. For individual business you will have to do medical, financial, and avocational underwriting.

- Anti-selection is much more of a problem with the individual life business, and this is exacerbated by selling through independent intermediaries.

- It is likely that the Individual life product will be sold to many self-employed people.

- Hence financial underwriting will be crucial, as opposed to the situation for group benefits where the benefit is based on a known salary.

ii. Factors defining the benefit:

- Definition of disability

- Waiting period

- Deferred period

- Linked-claims period (off period)

- Replacement ratio

- Escalation rate of benefits

- Before claim

- In payment

- Proportionate / rehabilitation benefit

- Benefit expiry age / retirement age Pricing assumptions:

- Need assumptions for both the best estimates and margins to be included

- Mortality:

- Pre claim

- During claim

- Claim termination rates This is dependent on:

- Recovery rates

- Mortality rates

- Investment return (to set up reserves):

- Before claim

- Once claim is in payment

- Tax on investment returns

- Cost of investment management

- Expense assumptions:

- Initial (incl. commission)

- Any on-going commission

- Claims assessment

- at claim inception and

- any subsequent re-assessments

- Expense inflation rate

iii. This is a new product, so you have no directly relevant past experience. It will thus be
necessary to make use of other data sources.
You have 20 years of group income protection experience so there should be a lot of data for short- to medium-term claims. There will be limited claims of duration over 10 years, but there will still be some data.

Provided there is enough group data, rates can be derived from first principles using multi-state models or a formula approach using two double decrement tables. Then smoothing techniques can be applied to smooth out the rates. Alternatively the current group income protection claim incidence and termination rates can be adjusted using the experience data.
If you decide that you can use the group experience you will need to:

- Make allowances for differences between individual and group business.

- Consider any trends in the group experience, and in particular if there have been major economic impacts (recessions or booms) which would have influenced the incidence and the termination rates. The difference in the products may impact the relevance of the group data as follows:

- Over-insurance, more likely in the individual life business, could negatively impact both the incidence rates and the termination rates.

- Individual life policies are usually sold with much shorter deferred periods, typically 7 days and 1 month, as opposed to group which usually have 3 and 6 month deferred periods. For the 7 day and 1 month deferred periods, you will experience very different incidence and termination rates to your group business. The incidence rates will increase significantly as there will be a lot more minor claims. The termination rates will also increase significantly due to the minor nature of the claims. It is not clear which of these two changes is more significant.

- Under group policies there is an employer involved who may be more or less motivated to help the person get back to work. For a self-employed person the dynamics are different. It is difficult to know which way this will influence the experience.

- There may also be differences in claims paying philosophy for the two products, which could have a very large impact on the experience. You would probably also ask a reinsurer to assist you with the pricing. The reinsurer would either use the experience from the local products that it reinsures, or use international experience, adjusted for any differences to the local product and market. Industry data could also be considered where available, and if deemed relevant. Parts (i) and (ii) were fairly well answered by the majority of candidates. Part (iii) was answered poorly by most candidates. Most candidates did not address the second half of the question which was "explaining to what extent the data from the company's group product may be relevant." Furthermore, for those that did mention the differences between group and individual income protection, most only listed the differences and did not explain the impact these differences would have on incidence and termination rates.

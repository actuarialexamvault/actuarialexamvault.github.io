## QUESTION 8

i. Risks:

- The risk to the company would depend on the products it sells and how it currently underwrites this target market.

- Mortality:

- Mortality experience may be worse than assumed.

- Mortality estimation, in particular for the high risk lives, would be more difficult as the result of not being allowed to request medical examinations.

- Mortality experience could also be worse than expected owing to the fact that HIV/AIDS exclusions cannot be used.

- The risk of anti-selection is also exacerbated.

- There is also the risk that applicants may be dishonest on their proposal forms, as it would not be picked up in a medical examination.

- Even with small sums assured the above still represent risks.

- Expenses:

- Although there could be expense savings in not having medical examinations which would offset increased costs related to implementing the change, expenses and expense inflation may be worse than expected.

- Business mix:

- The fact that rates may only differ by age means that companies will need to estimate the gender (and health) breakdown of policyholders.

- There is a risk that this will be incorrectly estimated as it may not stay as it is currently.

- Withdrawals:

- If it is now possible for males to get cheaper cover (as premium differentiation may not be based on gender) the company may face withdrawals, including lapse and re-entry.

- Lapse and re-entry will also be a problem in respect of lives who currently have HIV/AIDS exclusions, or loadings based on medical examinations, on their contracts.

- Competition:

- If premiums need to be increased on protection products to cope with the increased risk this may make the product uncompetitive.

- However, other insurers may be similarly affected reducing this risk.

- Higher overall prices in the market though may make products less affordable to the low income sector reducing sales.

- This may also exacerbate the anti-selection risk.

- Business volumes:

- Lower business volumes than anticipated (e.g. as outlined above) would impact on expense recoupment.

- If the restrictions in underwriting prove attractive, and underwriting appears more streamlined, more policies than anticipated may be sold.

- This could lead to higher new business strain than planned.

- There is a risk that the agreement/legislation may change again in the future. Reducing the risks through product design:

- Pricing could be done conservatively (by increasing margins) to reduce the risk of incorrect mortality estimation.

- Premiums could be made reviewable so that if experience is worse than expected then premiums could be increased.

- Sums insured could be limited to reduce the mortality risk.

- Waiting periods for death benefits (other than on accidental death) could be introduced to counter the worst cases of anti-selection.

- The terms of the policies could be reduced.

- Age limits could be imposed, for example it the risk was deemed to be too high at older ages.

- A pre-existing condition exclusion could be introduced (for conditions other than HIV/AIDS), although this would require that more emphasis be placed on claims underwriting.

- The company could focus on sales of products with larger savings components.

- Offering unitised products with variable charges could also reduce risk.

ii. Relative advantages of selling through the bank:

- Currently the bank has proved to be a good source of new business.

- It should provide access to a large (and "warm") customer base of individuals with bank accounts.

- By selling to appropriate individuals persistency should be fairly good.

- Systems for writing new business should be set up and working well. With a new direct marketing channel this would still need to be put in place.

- Sales costs could be relatively low, as marketing costs are low, leads are "warm" and the bank may carry out much of the initial administration.

- Sales costs will be largely commission-based relating to the volume sold, whereas direct marketing may have a large component of fixed (and set-up) costs.

- Theoretically the product does not have to be so competitive when sold through a bank.

- Persistency may be high, as the payment method is likely to use debit orders and the bank has information on the suitability of its clients.

- May be less anti-selection as sales are initiated by the bank, unlike in direct marketing (depending on the model of direct marketing used). Relative disadvantages of selling through the bank:

- The bank may place constraints on the product design and price.

- Many individuals in the low income sector may not be in the formal banking market, hence the bank may not reach the target market.

- The direct marketing route may have lower costs in the long run.

- There will be less control over how the product is sold through the bank than would be the case with direct marketing.

- Policy information may be captured inaccurately by the bank staff.

- Bank staff may sell inappropriately to the low-income market, and sales may be higher pressured than with direct marketing, leading to low persistency.

- If the parent sells this company there will be a large reduction in new business volumes. This question was not well answered by most candidates, with many answers being overly generic. High mortality (etc.) is not, per se, a risk. The risk is that it cannot be estimated correctly and that experience is worse than expected. Many candidates did not make this clear in their answers to part (i). Likewise, cross-subsidies are not a problem, the risk arises if the mix of business is different to than anticipated when allowing for the cross-subsidies in pricing. Many candidates discussed how the risks could be reduced by factors other than product design. Some candidates even spent time explaining how underwriting or reinsurance could be used, despite the question specifically excluding these factors. In part (ii) some candidates referred to "members" when presumably they were referring to policyholders.

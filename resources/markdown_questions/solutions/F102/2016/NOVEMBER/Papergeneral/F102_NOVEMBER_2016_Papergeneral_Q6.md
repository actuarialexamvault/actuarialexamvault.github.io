## QUESTION 6

(i)
Features of the gross premium valuation method:

- an explicit allowance is made for expenses

- an explicit allowance can be made for vested and expected future bonuses

- the future premiums valued are the actual ("office") premiums expected

- any differences between the pricing and valuation bases will immediately be taken as profit or loss

- a prudent basis should defer the release of profit over the lifetime of the policy

- reserves may initially be negative for non-linked business, partly due to initial expenses and partly due to capitalising the expected future profit

(ii)
This solvency margin provides an additional level of protection to policyholders (protection against insolvency, protection against systemic risk, to maintain market confidence, to reduce the risk of reserves being insufficient, to act as an early warning system for the supervisor) against future experience being worse than reserved for under the supervisory reserving basis.
The required margins in the reserve calculation and solvency margin calculation should reflect the risk of the insurer.
There is a direct relationship between the level of prudence in the supervisory reserves and a suitable level for the required solvency margin.
The level of prudence in the reserves (i.e. prescribed margins) implies that the minimum solvency margin required as protection for policyholders should be lower.
(iii)
Firstly, the insurer's historic expenses need to be investigated to estimate the expected level of future expenses.
The historic expenses will then need to be adjusted for various items, e.g. once-off expenses need to be removed from the analysis and known future changes, e.g. cost savings, can be allowed for including an allowance for trends that are shown by the past experience.
For reserving, the renewal recurring expenses would be the most important expenses that would need to be allowed for:

- Hence the investigation needs to differentiate between initial and renewal expenses,

- Once-off and recurring expenses, and

- Fixed and variable expenses Expenses would also need to be allocated to this product, as the company might have other products but the company might also use expenses data from other similar products. The most appropriate way in which expenses should be allowed for needs to be determined, including:

- Per policy expense

- Percentage of premium

- Percentage of sum assured

- Percentage of assets/reduction in discount rate Other expenses that might be considered are the following:

- Termination expenses on claim (i.e. claims underwriting expenses), and

- Termination expenses on withdrawal

The assumption can also be based on a market consistent approach, i.e. it can be based on quoted prices for administration outsourcing agreements.
Comments:

- This is a straightforward bookwork question and candidates who knew the bookwork did well.

- Some candidates lost easy by marks by not specifying their answers clearly. For example, they said that the gross premium valuation allows for expenses. This did not score any marks: to score marks it is necessary to say that this method explicitly allows for expenses, since even the net premium valuation allows for expenses, although this is implicit.

- Many candidates wrote that reinsurer can be approached to assist with setting the expense assumptions: this is unlikely, as reinsurers will usually not have access to their cedants' expense assumptions.

- For part (iii) many students referred to an "expense investigation", but didn't define what was meant by this. For part (iii) many students confused the terms "direct expenses" and "variable expenses" with each other. These two items are not always the same: direct expenses relate directly to a specific product and/or function, whereas variable expenses depend on the number of policies that are sold. For example, rent can be a direct expense if the specific rent relates to a single product, but it is not a variable expense

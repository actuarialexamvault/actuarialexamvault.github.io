## QUESTION 1

i. Parameters:

- Base Mortality rates

- Expenses

- Lapse rates

- Mortality trends

- Inflation - of expenses

- Interest rates

- Margins

- Profit requirements

- Anticipated volume of business

- Mix by distribution

- Average sums assured

ii. Base mortality:

- A good starting point will be the experience for the current book of business.

- Mortality for the new product is likely to be (significantly) worse due to the fact that there is very little underwriting.

- In particular you will need to add a loading for HIV, since an HIV test is not being done.

- The company may have experience on other products it writes, with limited underwriting, which could be used to calibrate the fully underwritten experience.

- You should make an allowance for anti-selection, given that no medical tests will be done.

- You can get pricing assistance from reinsurers, who may have experience on similar products. Expenses:

- The expense assumptions will be very different to those for your existing product.

- However, the total expenses may end up being similar.

- You do not need to make an allowance for commission.

- You need an estimate of the total marketing costs for the period over which you are doing the pricing.

- The take-up of policies per campaign / per Rand spent on marketing is a key assumption.

- The sums insured will be lower than for the existing product, so you will need to consider carefully how to spread the expense per policy.

- The underwriting expenses will be significantly less than for the existing product.

- Some of the expenses, e.g. policy administration, and claims, may be similar to those for the existing product.

- It might be more admin-intensive than broker business because the company has to interact directly with policyholders when selling directly (rather than this being via a broker). Lapses:

- The lapses are likely to be significantly different from those on the existing product.

- There are no intermediaries to keep the relationship with policyholders "warm".

- It is likely that there will be a high percentage of Not Taken Ups (NTUs).

- The existing product's lapse rates can be used as a starting point, but some margins should be built in to this.

- Consider the lapse rates of any other limited underwriting / direct product offerings the company has.

- Reinsurers may also be able to assist with setting this assumption. Expense inflation:

- This could be similar to the existing product.

- A good starting point could be CPI or salary inflation. Mortality trends:

- There are likely to be very little data in the sub-Saharan country.

- You could consider the company's existing data to detect any macro trends.

- It would be worth looking at trends in the country.

- You could approach a reinsurer for assistance. Interest rates:

- This is not a key assumption as there are no surrender values.

- You could use a similar assumption to that used for the existing product. Margin:

- There is a lot more risk in the new product, so higher margins than used for the existing product would be required.

- Higher margins will be required in respect of the assumptions where there is the most uncertainty. However, this will be restricted by the need to make the new product competitive.

Profit margin:

- As above, you would want to load this, but within reason.

- The profit margin could be the same as that for the existing product if you have allowed for sufficient risk margins.

- It will also depend on the value placed on getting a foothold in this market.

- Consideration should also be given as to the impact on the existing product. Mix by distribution channel:

- Some sensible assumption for the mix will be required.

- Sensitivity testing should be carried out. Volume of business:

- Consider the existing sales volumes and consult with the company's marketing staff to get an initial estimate.

- Consider how well such business has been doing in the country as a whole.

- Reinsurers may be able to provide input on this.

- Sensitivity testing will be important. Average sums insured:

- The current average sum assured would give an upper limit to the estimate.

- It might be possible to work backwards from an expected affordable premium.

- Sensitivity testing should be carried out. Part (i) was straightforward and was, as would be expected, generally well answered by candidates. Part (ii), a fairly straightforward pricing assumptions question, was generally very poorly handled. Surprisingly few candidates used the list of assumptions they had identified in part

(i) as the items needing to be covered in part (ii). Very few candidates could identify what the
three most important parameters were. Some did not even bother to try to do that (suggesting they did not even read the question carefully). Many chose the wrong three, which showed their lack of understanding of how to price a whole life product. Many candidates picked interest rate as a key parameter which given there is no surrender value, is not that crucial for pricing purposes. Some candidates even managed not to select mortality as a key parameter. Incredibly, some candidates while identifying the correct assumptions (or many of them) in part (i), simply ignored those identified and came up with others in part (ii).

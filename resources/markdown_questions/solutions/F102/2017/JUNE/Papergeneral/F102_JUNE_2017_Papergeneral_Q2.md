## QUESTION 2

i. The two ways for allocating UWP bonuses are:

- The price of a unit remains fixed and the insurer allocates additional units to each contract (usually annually) at the bonus declaration. There could be a minimum bonus declaration of zero or some positive percentage.

- The insurer changes the price of the units (usually on a daily basis). The increase is made up of a guaranteed part (possibly zero) and a bonus part.

ii. There is a difference in the way that the insurer determines the price of the units and
therefore the benefits payable.
For unit-linked business there is a direct link to a specified pool of assets, with unit prices being adjusted as and when the underlying asset values change.
With UWP business bonuses are allocated to the UWP fund at the discretion of the life office.
The key distinction is the discretion that the insurer has over the bonuses granted.
For UWP a terminal bonus could be added when the insured event occurs.
For unit-linked business there is no terminal bonus when the insured event occurs as unit prices change when the underlying asset values change.
For UWP the insurer will take a longer-term view of investment returns and smooth the bonuses it allocates.
For both products the surrender value will usually be the fund value (possibly less a surrender penalty).
However, for UWP the insurer may retain the right to apply a market value adjustment (MVA) at its discretion on surrender.
iii. Modelling could be carried out on a policy-by-policy basis using the full in-force policy
data.
Alternatively suitable model points representing the business can be used.
Model points should be selected such that the use of model points rather than the full inforce policy data will not materially impact on the results.
A stochastic model simulating investment returns would be used to project, for each time period:

- the value of the assets; and

Declared bonus rates will be linked to the projected investment returns and actual fund (asset share) for the policy.
Thus the model will allow for interaction between the cashflows.
The model will project, for each time period:

- withdrawal, death and maturity benefits

- charges, which are used to calculate the future unit fund

- insurer expenses (taking expense inflation into account)

- supervisory requirements to hold reserves Assumptions on mortality, withdrawal and expenses would take into account expected experience. These will probably be allowed for on a deterministic basis. Since investment returns are modelled stochastically, the inflation rate can also be modelled stochastically. All assumptions should be consistent with each other and allow for interactions between variables (e.g. investment return and expense inflation assumption and surrender rates could be linked to the economic scenario). Consider whether an annual or monthly time period is appropriate for projections to balance complexity and accuracy. The net cashflow for each time period:

- will be the net non-unit cash flow less the increase in the non-unit reserve

- will be projected to the termination of the policy

- will be discounted using an appropriate risk discount rate to obtain the present value

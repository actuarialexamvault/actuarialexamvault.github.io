## QUESTION 3

Insurer A could use a replicating portfolio approach where the value of the liabilities is determined as the value of a portfolio of assets that exactly match the cashflows of the liabilities (in this case a portfolio of zero-coupon government bonds of appropriate terms and amount), or by discounting future cashflows (expenses and annuity payments for the expected future lifetime of policyholders taking any minimum payment on death into account) at the risk free rate (using government bond yields or swap rates).
It might be possible to take credit for the illiquidity premium offered by corporate bonds (since the annuity cashflows are predictable and matching bonds held to maturity). However, this is unlikely to be accepted by Insurer A as this will reduce the transfer value of assets.
Generally Insurer A will lean towards including margins for uncertainty in the valuation which would increase the amount of assets that are transferred.
Insurer A may consider the impact of the transferred business on the overall risk of the business of the insurer when setting the margin for uncertainty. However, future cashflows for the annuity portfolio are not known with certainty.
It will be difficult to obtain a market-consistent assumption for mortality and expense assumptions as a deep and liquid market to trade these risks is unlikely to exist.
The assumptions could be set using a best estimate plus a risk margin reflecting the compensation required by the market for the uncertainty in each individual assumption, or the insurer could calculate a single risk margin using a cost of capital approach to determine the risk market.
The best estimate for mortality experience could be set with reference to insurer or industry experience or reinsurer information, and needs to include assumptions about mortality improvements.
The best estimate for expenses could be set with reference to insurer or industry data. Price inflation can be estimated using the difference between yields on conventional and indexlinked government bonds, but insurer expenses are unlikely to follow price inflation exactly (as salary expenses will increase with salary inflation).
This question was not answered well, which is disappointing given that it was a straightforward bookwork application question. Most candidates struggled to generate even half of the above points. A number of candidates wasted valuable time describing how assets would be valued, and gave the rationale and advantages of market-consistent valuations.

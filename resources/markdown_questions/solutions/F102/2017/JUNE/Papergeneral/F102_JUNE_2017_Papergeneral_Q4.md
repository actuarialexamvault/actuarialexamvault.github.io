## QUESTION 4

i. Principles:

- Surrender values should be affordable, i.e. should not exceed earned asset shares, in aggregate, over a reasonable time period.

- Surrender value designs should minimise the risk of selection against the company.

- E.g. by limiting the lapse-and-re-entry risk.

- Surrender values need to take account of policyholder reasonable expectations

(PRE).

- At early durations surrender values should not appear too low compared with premiums paid taking into account projections provided at outset.

- At later durations surrender values should be consistent with projected maturity values.

- Surrender values should maintain equity between:

- Surrendering and remaining policyholders: the profit taken should be consistent between exiting and remaining policyholders.

- Surrendering policyholders and shareholders: a reasonable profit can be extracted on surrender.

- Surrender values should take account of:

- Surrender values offered by competitors.

- Auction values.

- The approach should be practical:

- Not be subject to frequent change, unless dictated by market conditions.

- Not be too difficult to calculate, taking into account computing power available.

- Not be too difficult to explain to policyholders.

- Be capable of being documented clearly.

- Surrender values need to be in line with regulation if applicable.

- Avoid discontinuities in surrender value by policy term.

ii. Affordability:

- The surrender value at early durations is based on the earned asset share and therefore likely to be affordable.

- Losses will be made on early duration surrenders when the asset share is negative, as surrender values cannot be negative.

- Surrender values at later durations are likely to be smaller than the earned asset share, which includes historic margins.

- However, there is no guarantee that the prospective method will not result in surrender values that are consistently above the asset share.

PRE:

- Nevertheless, deductions for initial expenses may not seem reasonable to policyholders.

- The prospective approach is likely to meet PRE at later durations as it will tend to the sum assured payable on death. Equity:

- A surrender value based on the (positive) asset share means that the insurance company will not make any profit on early surrenders, which is generous to surrendering policyholders.

- The prospective method means that the insurance company will retain profit that has accrued to date of surrender (broadly), which seems equitable.

- However, no margins that are expected to emerge in the future will accrue to the shareholders and some shareholders may view this as unreasonable. Consistency with competition:

- The method could be consistent with that used by competitors.

- The prospective method is likely to be consistent with auction values Practicality & Regulation:

- Because the surrender value later in the policy term is based on the current premium basis, the risk of lapse-and-re-entry is managed.

- If information to calculate the earned asset share is available the retrospective approach should not be overly complex to calculate.

- The prospective method should be easy to calculate since it does not require any knowledge of past experience.

- There is a risk that there are discontinuities in the surrender values when moving from the retrospective to the prospective method.

- Because premium bases are generally not changed frequently, the surrender values should not change frequently.

- However, at early durations, asset shares based on actual experience, could be volatile.

- There should not be any problems with regulation (unless, for example, minimum surrender values are specified).

- This method may be complicated to explain to policyholders.

iii. Possible changes:

- Consider using a basis that is closer to the realistic prospective reserve (particularly at later durations) thus reducing surrender values.

- Include a condition that the surrender value may not be higher than the asset share when the prospective approach is applied

- Move from the retrospective basis to the prospective basis at an earlier duration. to retain more profit.

The majority of candidates did very well on part (i) which was a standard bookwork question.
However, candidates struggled to critique the proposal in part (ii). The question required an "explanation" and candidates often made vague or unsubstantiated statements e.g. "the method is easy to implement", without explaining the rationale why this is so. Answers were often not tailored to the specific scenario provided in the question. For example, a significant number of candidates suggested that the product has a maturity value - which suggests some term product - when the question stated the product is a whole of life product.

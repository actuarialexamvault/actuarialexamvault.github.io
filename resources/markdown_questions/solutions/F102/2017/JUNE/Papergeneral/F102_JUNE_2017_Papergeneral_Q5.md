## QUESTION 5

i. The impact of regulations include:

- Restrictions on the type of assets that can be invested in.

- Restrictions on the amount that can be invested in particular assets (to prevent concentration risk). These can be applied per asset class, per currency, per individual asset.

- Restrictions on the extent to which assets of a particular type can be included when demonstrating solvency.

- Maximum counterparty exposure to an individual company or individual (to reduce credit risk).

- Solvency capital may have to be invested in specific assets.

- Limitations on the extent to which mismatching is allowed.

- A requirement to hold a mismatch reserve or solvency capital if applicable.

- Prescribed assets i.e. a requirement to invest a minimum proportion of assets in specific types of investments (usually government bonds).

- Rules on how to value assets, incl. unlisted assets, depreciation of fixed assets.

- Tax regulation may treat some types of assets more favourably than others. .

- Regulations might require independent custodians.

ii. Reasons for a high level of fixed-interest investments include:

- The company might have a relatively high level of guaranteed benefits (basic sums assured and reversionary bonuses) which are best matched by fixed-interest stocks.

- The high level of guarantees might be due to:

- A young book of policies (hence the sum assured is a large proportion of the liabilities).

- The company may have a policy of higher than average sum assured for a given premium.

- The company may have a policy of higher than average reversionary bonuses and lower terminal bonuses.

- Low free assets may lead to the regulator requiring higher levels of fixed-interest assets to reduce the risk of insolvency.

- Even if not required by the regulator, the company's risk appetite may require less volatile assets when free assets are low.

- The company may wish to protect its solvency position in order to continue writing new business.

- The company might expect fixed-interest assets to generate the best returns.

- Other liabilities might require matching with fixed-interest stocks (e.g. withoutprofit products).

- If solvency admissibility rules place no limit on fixed-interest assets the company will want to make sure all its assets are counted for demonstrating solvency. If other insurers have relatively high free assets then they will not be as heavily affected by this restriction.

- Risk-based solvency requirements might be lower for fixed-interest assets.

- If decrements are higher, or less predictable, than average then fixed-interest assets might be suitable due to generally good liquidity. This question was answered reasonably well, although it could have been done better. Part (i) was very straightforward, yet a number of candidates struggled to think broadly enough to score full marks. Part (ii) was also straightforward, yet a number of candidates showed very weak understanding of the components of with-profits liabilities, and how each component should be matched. A number of candidates made senseless comments e.g. "Tax incentives/regulations could have led to the high fixed-interest holding", without thinking that such incentives/regulations would have affected other insurers too.

## QUESTION 6

i. The cost of a mortality option is the value of the excess of the premium that should, in the
light of full underwriting information, have been charged for the additional assurance over the normal premium rate that is charged.
If a life, who is in good health and who would be expected to satisfy normal underwriting requirements, exercises the option, then the option will generate little or no additional costs. The exercise of the option by lives in poor health will generate considerable additional costs.

Some factors affecting the cost of mortality options:

- The term of the policy with the option. The longer the term, the longer the policyholder will have the option, and the more likely it is that, at some time, his or her health will make the option appear worthwhile.

- The number of times the policyholder gets the chance to exercise the option, e.g. every five years, on every policy anniversary or at any time whatsoever. Restricting the points of time at which the option can be exercised can reduce the risk of anti-selection.

- Conditions attaching to exercising the option such as limiting the size of the option or restricting the percentage increase in sum assured available under the option.

- The proportion of lives that choose to exercise the option. In general, the smaller the proportion who exercise the option, the worse will be the subsequent mortality experience of those exercising the option. If a substantial proportion exercises the option, then their subsequent mortality experience will on average be less extreme.

- The encouragement given to policyholders to exercise the option. Publicising the option more widely can achieve greater take up by healthy lives, but care should be taken that the benefit (from future profits) is not outweighed by the risk of attracting a bigger proportion of the loss-making high risk lives from taking up the option as well.

- The extra cost to the policyholder who exercises the option. If the option involves a steep increase in premiums, then the healthier lives might shop around to try to get the same cover cheaper elsewhere. This means that the company will lose out on the potential profit that these policyholders would have generated.

- Selective withdrawals. A healthy life may cancel a ten-year renewable term assurance policy after two years because he or she discovers that the cover without mortality options is much cheaper. The company has not in this case collected the option loading from this person for very long, but is still left with the unhealthy lives who will exercise the option to the cost of the company.

ii. Underwriting considerations:

- Does any training for underwriting staff need to be carried out to ensure that the underwriters better understand the risks involved with mortality options.

- It may need to make underwriting stricter at the outset of the policy to avoid antiselection and to assess whether the risk is acceptable and, if so, setting the appropriate premium. This may also lead to the underwriting system needing to be updated to capture additional information due to stricter underwriting.

- Reviewing the information currently requested from a potential policyholder and determining whether additional medical, lifestyle and financial underwriting needs to be conducted.

- Financial underwriting will become more important especially for options where policyholders have the ability to increase their sum assured.

- If the product is going to be reinsured, the reinsurer may require certain changes to the underwriting process or require a certain level of underwriting to be in place. The reinsures may also change the referral limits for underwriting. This could have an impact on turnaround times.

- If policyholders are not given standard rates, the company needs to decide the terms and conditions attached to the options. Will these be issued on the same terms or will the company decline to offer the option on the policy or offer different terms.

iii. The company needs to consider:

- What products are being offered by its competitors. If competitors are selling term assurance products with mortality options attached to them, then the company may need to start offering similar products if it wants to maintain market share. If competitors are not selling these products, then they may decide to enter the market to differentiate themselves from competitors.

- However, if the product is not offered in the market then the company runs the risk of being selected against if it starts to attract a disproportionate number of unhealthy lives due to offering this option

- Whether there is a need in the market for such a product and whether consumers are looking for and purchasing these options.

- If so, then is the option to increase the level of cover during the term of the policy or the option to renew the policy at the end of its original term without providing additional evidence of health be offered, or both.

- Whether the company is going to continue selling term assurance products without mortality options.

- Whether its administration systems can capture the new product design features. If not, the cost of a new system needs to be considered.

- The extra cost in extra training of staff and extra marketing literature need to be taken into account.

- The company needs to determine how it is going to value these options (North American Method or Conventional method)

- The charging structure and whether the option be profit neutral or profit making needs to be determined if it is going to be put in place.

- Whether it wishes to take on the extra risk and whether the increase in sales volume and future profit justify taking on the additional risk.

- The impact on capital requirements when selling the policy initially and also at the time when the option is exercised....

- If a number of policyholders exercise the option in the future, it could cause a large financial strain on the company if these have a major impact on their capital requirements.

- The policy wording and contract terms, to ensure these are not unfair and that customers are treated fairly.

- The policy wording must also be watertight, to avoid the company being exposed to unintended risks as a result of providing the options.

- To determine if the company is going to reinsure the new product or not. If it is going to reinsure the new product, what are the views of the reinsurer in terms of product design and pricing.

- The impact on its current book of business and whether a special offer allowing existing policyholders to switch to the new product will be allowed.

- If existing policyholders are not allowed to switch to the new product the company could suffer losses due to lapse and re-entry.

- The sales channel used to sell the products and if appropriate, how commission will be calculated for policies exercising the options. Part (i) was generally poorly answered and highlighted candidates' lack of bookwork knowledge and poor exam technique. A large proportion of candidates chose to list the factors affecting the cost of a mortality option rather than outlining the factors and hence scored poorly on the question. Many candidates that did outline the factors did not provide enough points to score well. In part (ii) a number of candidates focused on the impact additional underwriting would have on the cost of the product and also the marketability, rather than the underwriting process. Generally candidates did not provide enough points to score well on the question. Part (iii) was generally well answered by most candidates.

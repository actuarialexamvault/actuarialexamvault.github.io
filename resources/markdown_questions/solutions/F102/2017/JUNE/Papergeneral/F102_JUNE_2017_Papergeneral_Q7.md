## QUESTION 7

i. Mortality risk:

- Mortality experience may turn out to be higher than expected when pricing the product.

- This risk is exacerbated by the lack of relevant data to price the product, and having to base assumptions on products which could have very different experience.

- Since a single mortality assumption is used for all policies there is a risk that the mix of business is not as expected.

- E.g. The average age of lives insured may be higher than that assumed in the pricing.

- The insurer is exposed to random fluctuations in mortality experience, particularly if business volumes for this product are low.

- Anti-selection is also a risk, as obtaining cover through the funeral parlour scheme is voluntary (and underwriting is likely to be limited).

- The extent of the anti-selection risk depends on whether there is a waiting period for cover.

- There may be a risk of claims fraud (false death claims).

- There is a risk of a concentration or aggregation of risk (as lives are not independent when the whole family is covered).

Persistency risk:

- As the business is renewable annually there is a risk that annual renewals are lower than expected or lapses are higher than expected.

- This could be lapses of individual policies and/or cancellation of the distribution relationship with certain funeral parlours.

- In particular there is a risk of higher withdrawals than expected at early durations when the asset share is negative, as initial expenses will not have been recouped and a loss will be made.

- There is the possibility of selective withdrawals where healthier lives withdraw leaving a pool of lives in worse health than anticipated.

- This is exacerbated by the fact that premiums are not differentiated by the risk presented by the policyholder

- Low persistency can adversely affect expense experience as there will be fewer policies to contribute towards fixed expenses.

- The risk relating to correctly estimating persistency is exacerbated by:

- Competition in the market;

- Low income policyholders struggling to pay premiums; and

- Possible mis-selling of products to the financially unsophisticated target market. Expenses risk:

- There is a risk that actual expenses (including business acquisition and ongoing administration expenses) are higher than assumed in the pricing.

- Expense assumptions will depend on business volume assumptions (new business and persistency of business).

- Lower than expected business volumes may mean that the insurer does not cover fixed costs.

- If the company writes more business than expected the capital required to support the business may be higher than what was budgeted for by the insurer.

- There are likely to be significant cross-subsidies in the pricing (e.g. by business volume per funeral parlour).

- Thus there is a risk of the mix of business being different to that expected in the pricing, leading to an incorrect expense loading.

ii. The insurer will aim to investigate whether any differences in actual experience compared
to the experience expected in the pricing for mortality, persistency, expenses, business mix and business volumes would explain the losses for this business.
For the mortality and persistency investigations:

- Group the data by possible rating factors to consider the effect of business mix, e.g. size of group, age, funeral parlour.

The insurer would want to investigate the reasons for differences from expectations, and whether these are once-off or indicate a trend.
Investigate claims assessment processes to identify weaknesses in processes that may be allowing claims fraud.
Investigate customer satisfaction and reasons for funeral parlours terminating the sales distribution agreement and lapses of individual policyholders.
Conduct an expense analysis to investigate what would be a fair share of the acquisition costs, ongoing costs and contribution to fixed expenses relative to sales volumes by funeral parlour.
Investigate whether business volumes or business mix (e.g. group size) have impacted on the expenses per policy.
Investigate whether there may have been changes in the actions of the insurer (e.g. marketing campaigns).
Investigate whether there may have been external influences (e.g. changes in the competitive environment) The insurer could compare its experience to other insurers offering similar products in the market, if available.
iii. High mortality:

- Differentiate mortality assumptions used for pricing by age, gender, etc.

- Change the mortality pricing assumption and hence increase premiums (although this could have negative consequences, such as a loss of business and increased anti-selection).

- Consider experience rating for funeral parlours with large sales volumes.

- Change the design of the product (e.g. introduce waiting periods or a maximum age at entry for the main member and immediate family).

- Exclude claims from pre-existing conditions to reduce anti-selection.

- Improve claims verification processes (e.g. develop a system of flags and checks to alert the insurer to possible claims fraud in specific groups).

- Increase initial underwriting to reduce mortality and allow more accurate estimates of mortality to be made, although limited underwriting may be expected on this product.

Low retentions:

- Change the persistency pricing assumption and hence increase premiums (although this would reduce competitiveness).

- Change sales agent remuneration structures to reward agents for persistency of the business.

- Ensure that sales methods focus on ensuring that the product meets the funeral parlour distributor's needs before they take out cover.

- Improve customer service (e.g. introduce a helpline for queries).

- Add attractive features to the product, possibly linked to loyalty (e.g. free cell phone vouchers or financial education sessions).

- Allow a certain number of premiums to be missed before the policy lapses.

- Offer a premium discount on renewal.

- Ensure product stays competitive in respect of premiums and commissions. Part (i) was answered reasonably well by the better prepared candidates. Some candidates, however, did not make it clear that it is higher mortality (etc.) then expected which is the risk and not high mortality per se. Some candidates did not seem to know what persistency means, claiming that higher persistency than expected would be a problem. Several candidates did not identify the fact that it is, in particular, early withdrawals (when asset share is negative) which are problematic. Part (ii) was generally not well answered. Most candidates did not suggest a sufficient number of different investigations, and focused on mortality, withdrawal and expense experience investigations. Several candidates gave too much detail for each of these, and did not "outline briefly" as required. Some candidates just listed investigations, which again was not answering the question. Some candidates also wasted time by suggesting ways the insurer could deal with problems picked up in the investigations, which was not asked for. Part (iii) was generally well answered by the majority of candidates. Several candidates wasted time by giving more than the required four actions for each problem - only the first four provided were marked.

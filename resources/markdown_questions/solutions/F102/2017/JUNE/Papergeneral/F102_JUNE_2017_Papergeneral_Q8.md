## QUESTION 8

i. LTC insurance provides for the costs of long term care, which incorporates all forms of
continuing personal or nursing care and associated domestic services.
The cover is intended for people who are unable to look after themselves without some degree of support.
It may be provided in the insured's own home, at a day centre, or in a State-sponsored or care-home setting.
It can be funded by the state, private funding by individuals or charities.
It can be provided on an indemnity basis, or a non-indemnity (cash benefit basis).

ii. Marketability & Meeting customers' needs:

- The benefit provides greater flexibility of the whole of life product, as the LTC benefit can be used to fund long term care costs.

- The mortality improvement experience in the country increases the need for long term care benefits (older people are living longer and are likely to need assistance and frail care); thus the benefit should go some way towards meeting customers' needs.

- The proposed benefit is innovative, which might appeal to brokers selling this business and prospective clients.

- The marketing literature will need to be updated, and the key features of the rider benefit explained in clear language to ensure the product is understood.

- The distribution channel will also need to be able to explain the product (in particular the claim conditions and benefits) clearly.

- For the unit-linked whole of life assurance and LTC benefit the policyholder bears the investment risk of low unit growth in the fund resulting in benefits being lower than anticipated.

- However the minimum guarantee on the LTC benefit provides some security to policyholders

- The benefits are not designed to indemnify LTC costs, which could reduce marketability and lead to policyholder dissatisfaction if there are large gaps between costs and benefits.

- The insurer should thus try to ensure that the minimum guaranteed monthly annuity is set appropriately.

- The added cost of this guarantee, however, may be high and could thus impact on marketability.

- The lack of a guaranteed death benefit and the fact that the death benefit will be low immediately after an LTC claim (as the unit fund falls to zero) may reduce marketability.

- On an LTC claim the benefit is an annuity rather than a lump sum, reducing the flexibility of the use of the benefit.

- The insurer's reputation may be damaged if there is any miss-selling or if policyholders' long-term care benefits are too low (and insufficient to meet the cost of care).

- The fact that there is a surrender value may increase marketability of the product if no such benefit is available on the insurer's standard whole of life product.

- The insurer could consider ways to improve the benefits provided to better meet consumers' needs, but such improvements will come at a cost which may negatively impact marketability. Profitability & competitiveness:

- The insurer will need to ensure that the charges are such that the addition of the rider benefit will prove to be profitable.

- As the insurer currently mainly sells whole life assurance products it is unlikely to have sufficient data on mortality improvements at older ages to set appropriate pricing and reserving assumptions) for the annuity.

- The insurer will have to source this externally (most likely from industry data or from a reinsurer).

- Charges will also need to cover any development and additional administration expenses.

- Poor unit growth rates and the deduction of risk charges from the unit fund may lead to charges not being sufficient to cover insurer's expenses.

- The charges for the LTC cover will need to be competitive.

- This may conflict with the profitability requirement. Financing requirements:

- The guaranteed minimum annuity payment will likely lead to higher risk based capital requirements.

- Stochastic modelling will need to be carried out to value the guarantee.

- The insurer will need to decide the extent to which the risk charges will be variable as this will impact on risk and financing requirements. Risk characteristics:

- The insurer will need to decide on what level of risk is acceptable.

- The company could consider ways of reducing the risk, e.g. reinsurance.

- There is an anti-selection risk, with those who need care the most being the most likely to take out the rider benefit.

- There is also the risk of selective withdrawals, with healthy lives surrendering their policies, and the insurer only being left with unhealthy lives who are more likely to claim the LTC benefit.

- As the rider is only available on new policies there is a risk of lapse and re-entry from existing policyholders if the benefit is deemed attractive.

- This could result in not covering expenses as well as selective withdrawals. Other considerations:

- Increased administration will be required to support and manage this more complex product design; administration expenses will increase.

- Systems development may be required to support the new product (guaranteed annuity payments).

- The insurer will need to implement stringent claims underwriting (when long term care benefits are triggered) to reduce fraudulent claims.

- Will need to develop clear rules to determine whether policyholder qualifies for long term care benefits, e.g. certain activities of daily living can't be performed, etc.

- Consider the investment strategy for the non-unit fund relating to the guaranteed annuity benefit.

- The insurer might need to approach a reinsurer to assist with data, pricing, and reserving, etc. Many candidates scored poorly in part (ii), often because one of the following applied:

- They did not make a reasonable attempt (possibly due to poor time allocation).

- They just listed the factors or posed them as questions to be considered, instead of discussing them.

- They made little attempt to apply the generic bookwork points to the specifics of the question.

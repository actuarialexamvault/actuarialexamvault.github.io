## QUESTION 2

i.
Checks include:

- Reconciliation of current data with data from the previous valuation using data movements.

- Check data movements against accounting data (e.g. movements off with claims paid).

- Consistency checks (e.g. average sum assured for each class of business is sensible and consistent with values from previous valuation).

- Check for unusual values (e.g. unreasonably large sum assured or low premium).

The supervisor may require margins to be added to the best-estimate assumptions, due to the inherent uncertainty in the assumptions and cashflows.
This risk margin would reflect the compensation required by the "market" in return for taking on uncertain aspects of the liability cashflows.
Projections would be done on a monthly basis for accuracy.
Cashflows will be projected until the last policy has gone off the books.
The net cashflow (benefits plus expenses less premiums) will be discounted using the risk free rate a discount rate as appropriate for a market consistent valuation basis.
The risk free rate may be determined based on government bond yields or swap rates if there is a sufficiently deep and liquid swap market.
The results should be checked for reasonability, e.g. by reconciling the results with the last supervisory valuation. iii.
Mortality investigation process: The whole life product for higher income customers is a well-established product and the new product has been sold for a number of years so there should be a sufficient volume of stable data internal data to use for this exercise.
Consider the period of data to be used for the product so that information is not outdated.
Divide data into homogenous groups: by product (higher income and low income), age, gender, sales channel, region etc.
Ensure that there are enough data in each group to make the analysis for that group statistically credible.
Calculate the crude mortality rate by taking the number of deaths divided by the exposed to risk for each homogeneous group.
Compare the results of the experience investigation with the mortality assumption and standard mortality tables.
Investigate whether there is any evidence of trends in the mortality experience.
Also investigate any unusual circumstances that could have affected the mortality experience. iv.
Actions could include: Change the assumptions used in pricing and reserving to reflect the actual mortality experience results from the investigation.

- Increasing the pricing assumptions and the premiums may result in lower business volumes and impact on the contribution of the premium income from this business to overheads.

- Higher best-estimate mortality expenses will increase the reserves for these policies, possibly impacting on the solvency position of the insurer. Change the product design. E.g. Increase the waiting period for the product for low-income consumers, to manage the risk of anti-selection.

Change underwriting and claims management processes.
Strengthen the claims validation process to reduce fraudulent claims.

- Increases reputational risk as above. Introduce individual underwriting for product for low-income consumers.

- This will increase the cost of the product.

- This makes the sales process for these policies more onerous and time consuming and could lead to lower business volumes. Other actions: Try to target lower risk lives through the sales and market strategy and distribution channels used to market the product.

- May be costly and not lead to the desired results. Stop selling the products.

- Consider the impact on the loss of premium volumes from this business on the contributions to the overheads of the business. Continue to monitor the experience and only take action if the trend continues (or worsens) for a significant period. Consider a reviewable premium structure

- Allows premiums to be increased in deteriorating mortality experience.

Part (i) was bookwork.
For part (ii) better performing candidates described the various aspects of the process (data, model, assumptions). Few marks were awarded for simple lists included in the solution as the instruction was to describe the process.
Part (iii) was generally well answered. Marks were not given for actions the insurer may take in response to the results as this is asked in part (iv).
Part (iv) was generally well answered; better candidates provided a wide range of potential solutions, and described the potential impacts of the actions that the insurer could take.

## QUESTION 5

i.
Similarities in product design:

- The definition of disability would be broadly the same, viz. temporarily or permanently unable to do one's job/occupation.

- The sum insured/benefit level would be similar, and linked to an individual's remuneration, with an appropriate replacement ratio.

- A claim, once in payment, would usually increase, with inflation, or at a fixed percentage.

- The benefit term would be similar, up to normal retirement age:

- However, for the group product there will be less, or no, flexibility, with the employer choosing the retirement age.

- Both products would have the option of paying a partial benefit, if the claimant is able to return to work on a part-time basis. Differences in product design:

- It is likely that the deferred period will be longer for the group product, typically 1, 3 or 6 months. For individual products the waiting period is typically 7 days or 1 month.

- Reason. Formally employed people usually have significant paid sick leave, hence the longer waiting period. Self-employed people, who purchase income protection, typically don't have sick leave and hence need a pay-out from as early as possible.

- Individual products are typically "priced for life" and will often have 5 to 10 year premium guarantees. Group products are priced on an annually renewable basis, with at most a 3 year rate guarantee.

- Reason. This is how group products have traditionally been priced, and it is usual to get a re-rate, and perhaps move the scheme, every several years.

- The definition of income may be different.

- Reason. For group products the definition will generally be linked to how the company defines remuneration. For individual (self-employed) people the calculation of income is more complex and will often include a benefit to cover the expenses of the company, on a temporary basis. ii. Assumption setting:

- Consider your company's existing individual life experience but making sure that there is enough data, over enough time.

- You will use this data for mortality rates (pre-claim), disability inception rates, and termination rates (death and return to work).

- An allowance must be made for any differences in the product design, for example a longer deferred period will have a significant impact on both the incidence and termination rate and in the target market. For example, there may be more manual/blue collar workers in the group market.

- For expenses, you could look at your recent expense investigation but allowing for the fact that there may be some significant differences, for example commission structure may be different, there should be some economies of scale.

- You need to allow for any regulatory or tax differences between the two products.

- You need to ensure that the past data is relevant for forward projections, which it may not be as income protection experience is linked to the performance of the economy.

- Your investment and risk discount rates will be broadly similar to what you use for the individual product, perhaps with a slightly higher risk discount rate (RDR) to allow for the uncertainty

- You will probably need to involve reinsurers who have experience in this market, particularly since the insurer may not have sufficient internal data and experience to make necessary adjustments for changes in the product.

Part (i) was very poorly answered by most candidates. Better answers discussed the product features and gave the reasons for the differences as asked. Weaker answers rambled on about various aspects of managing the products.
For Part (ii) better answers started with inception and termination rates. A surprisingly large number of weaker answers started with a mortality assumption. The better answers also described how the assumptions would be set.

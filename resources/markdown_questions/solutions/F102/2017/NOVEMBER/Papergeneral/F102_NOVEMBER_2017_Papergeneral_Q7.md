## QUESTION 7

i.
Matching investments:

- Hence care costs are linked to a combination of:

- Living costs (food, clothing, heating and amenities) which may be linked to Consumer Price Inflation (CPI).

- Housing costs (rent, mortgage payments, property rates and taxes) may be linked to CPI.

- Personal care costs (i.e. carer or nursing costs) may be linked to average salary inflation (or higher due to scarce skills).

- Other needs may include intermediate/recuperative care costs (following an acute event requiring hospitalisation) may be linked to medical inflation.

- Care costs are therefore likely to increase somewhere between CPI, salary and medical inflation, and unit-linked fund assets should be invested in assets that can be expected to generate similar returns:

- Equities and property can be expected to generate positive real returns over long periods, however market values can be volatile over short/medium terms.

- Offshore equities and property provide diversification benefit, and some protection against inflation (if this is caused by weakening currency, which may be important for medical inflation).

- Developing market equities and property might provide enhanced returns (due to faster growing economies) but returns may be very volatile (hence exposure should be limited).

- CPI-linked government bonds (smaller extent), since some costs are expected to increase by CPI.

- Direct property has the disadvantages of high dealing costs and low marketability, so a small fund may consider investing property indirectly.

- As the fund is small, exposure to these asset classes should be via collective investment schemes in order to benefit from diversification. ii. The two main methods are:

- Market option pricing method.

- Consider market prices for options that replicate the guarantee, for example European put options on interest rates, call options on bond prices, or swaption prices (for a swap to receive fixed and pay variable).

- Options terms (interest rate, duration) should reflect the annuity guarantees.

- If market prices are not available estimates can be provided by market participants.

- Stochastic simulation method.

- Using a stochastics model of interest rates project interest rates (bond yields) to those ages where the option could be exercised.

- Assess the probability of interest rates falling below the guaranteed rate, and the average difference, and apply to projected fund values to estimate the potential cost.

iii.
Investment implications:

- The insurer's charge for the guarantee (which flows into the non-unit fund) should be invested to match the potential cost.

- As the potential cost of the guarantee increases when interest rates fall, the charge could be invested in:

- Long-dated bonds (however this won't provide a sufficient hedge).

- European put options on interest rates.

- Call options on bond prices.

- Swaptions (for a swap to receive fixed and pay variable).

- Futures (long on bonds, or short on interest rates), however this hedge is unlikely to be perfect.

**[Total 15]**

This question was relatively poorly answered.
For part (i) many candidates did not discuss the nature of long-term care costs in sufficient detail as a basis for the selection of the assets for the unit fund. Many candidates failed to link their solution to the considerations for a unit-linked fund. Some candidates gave vague points e.g. increase by inflation (rather than price inflation or CPI).
For part (ii) and (iii) many candidates failed to give the full description of the appropriate option.

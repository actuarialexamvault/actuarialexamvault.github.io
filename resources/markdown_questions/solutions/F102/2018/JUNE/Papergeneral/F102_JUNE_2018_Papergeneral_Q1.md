## QUESTION 1

i. Reasons:

- Retaining the policy gives the company the opportunity to:

- Have the policy make some contribution to overheads.

- Possibly make some profit on the smaller policy.

- Retains the formal relationship with the policyholder for possible future opportunities.

ii. Considerations:

- Terms after the alteration should be supportable by the earned asset share.

- The terms should avoid selection against the company, viz.:

- Alterations should avoid lapse and re-entry.

- Increases in benefits may require underwriting.

- The future profits earned from the altered policy should be fair.

- The terms offered should be fair to both policyholders that are altering their policies and those that are not.

- Ensure consistency with boundary conditions.

- E.g. The premium after reducing the sum assured should be consistent with paid-up values (where the future premium is zero).

- Increases in benefits should be consistent with taking out a new policy.

- The surrender value before the alteration should be similar to the surrender value after alteration.

- Policyholders' reasonable expectations may play a role, for example:

- The terms offered at early duration should look reasonable compared to premiums paid to date.

- The benefits offered close to maturity should look reasonable compared to the original maturity benefit, given the type of alteration (e.g. future premiums may not be payable)

- The alteration should be stable, i.e. small changes in benefits should lead to small changes in premiums.

- The alteration basis should not change too often, unless financial conditions require a change.

- Costs relating to the alteration should be covered.

- Consider the ease of explanation to the policyholder, ease of administration and documentation.

- Alteration terms offered by competitors should be considered

- The potential requirements imposed by regulation / professional guidance should be considered.

iii. Alternatives:

- Allow a change of the endowment assurance product to a term assurance product. Removing the savings component will lead to a lower price.

- Allow a change of the whole life product to a term assurance product. Limiting the term will remove the effect of higher mortality at higher ages and payment of the benefit will no longer be certain, reducing the premium.

- Allow an increase in term on the endowment assurance product. The benefit will, on average, be paid later, which will lead to a reduction in the premium.

iv. Other elements that may be impacted:

- Lower investment returns.

- Could affect maturity.

- This could lead to policyholder dissatisfaction and marketing risk.

- Could reduce solvency as free assets reduce.

- The situation would be worse if the company is not matched.

- This may require a change in investment strategy

- For unit-linked business profits could reduce, as much income will be linked to the value of the units.

- For with-profits business the company will have to declare minimum bonus levels, but may not have sufficient returns (particularly if return is negative).

- May cause guarantees to bite, and will need to reserve accordingly.

- The increased uncertainty may increase the cost of capital required by shareholders, which:

- May have a negative impact on premiums.

- May make it difficult to raise capital if needed.

- New business could reduce due to a reduced disposable income of consumers.

- This in turn may have a negative effect on the unit costs of policies as the in force book declines.

- There may be an increase in competitive pressures as the demand for products decreases.

- Expenses could be higher due to higher inflation.

- The company may have to consider retrenchments to manage costs, which will negatively affect employee morale.

- Fraud may rise, from both staff and policyholders.

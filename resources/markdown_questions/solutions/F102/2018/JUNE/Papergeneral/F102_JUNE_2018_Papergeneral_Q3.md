## QUESTION 3

i. Market-consistent value:

- First project the net liability cash outgo that would be expected in each future year from the existing portfolio of policies. In this case, the cashflows will include annuity payments and expenses.

- Assuming the cashflows are certain and guaranteed amounts, the market-consistent value is then found by discounting the cashflows at current risk-free rates of interest.

- The risk-free rate of interest to discount a guaranteed cashflow due in t years' time would be the current market redemption yield on a secure (probably governmentbacked) zero-coupon bond of the same term. Index-linked bond returns should be used for index-linked annuities.

- A deduction for credit risk might be required if there is a risk that the developing country's government could default on its debt.

- Alternatively, determine the portfolio of such zero-coupon bonds that could be owned at the present time that would produce exactly the same future cashflows as the liabilities. (This is referred to as the "replicating portfolio" of assets.)

- The current market value of this portfolio is then the required market-consistent valuation. (The two approaches are identical.)

- The market values of the replicating portfolio of assets (or equivalently the riskfree interest rates) may need adjustment for any short-term anomalies in the market at the present time.

- In this example, uncertainty is due to mortality, inflation, and any other factor that could affect the real level of future expenses (including future volumes of in-force policies).

- If we projected cashflows using best-estimate assumptions for these variables, the value we would obtain for the liabilities using the above approach would be lower than market value.

- This is because a purchaser of the liability would require additional compensation, for the possibility that the liability should turn out to be more expensive than expected.

- To allow for this uncertainty, we would need to include "appropriate" margins in the expense, inflation and mortality assumptions, compared with best estimate.

- Some market-based indicators for some of these parameters might be available, and would help determine the suitable level of margin to use.

- For example:

- The difference between the current market yields of equivalent fixed-interest and index-linked bonds gives an indication of the market's expectation for future inflation.

- There might be firms who provide third-party administration services for life insurers, whose fees for taking on the admin for the portfolio would be the market value of the expenses.

- As a liquid market for mortality risk does not exist, a risk margin may be added to the best estimate assumption to reflect the compensation required by the market for taking on the uncertainty.

- Alternatively, an overall risk margin could be added to liabilities calculated on best-estimate assumptions, based on a cost of capital approach.

ii. Advantages:

- This will allow the insurer to value the liabilities using a higher discount rate assumption; thus reducing the value of the liabilities.

- The illiquidity premium is market sensitive, i.e. this is expected to increase during periods where there is general high illiquidity.

- This will enable the insurance company to manage its balance sheet position better (by reducing the asset-liability mismatch) during periods of stressed liquidity in the market.

- This may be in line with the methodology followed by other annuity providers. Disadvantages:

- Additional volatility in the illiquidity premium assumption may result in more volatile liabilities (which will increase earnings volatility).

- It might be difficult to get approval from the regulator, with little chance of success, and onerous conditions might be imposed on the insurer.

Difficulties:

- The market for infrastructure bonds in the emerging market is likely to be very small, illiquid and not transparent.

- This makes it difficult to accurately estimate the market consistent assumption for the illiquidity premium.

- Theoretical models need to be constructed to determine this assumption, which may be complex and difficult to calibrate due to limited market data.

iii. Restrictions:

- The liquidity premium is only one component of the total spread between the yield of an asset and the liquid risk-free rate. As such, the insurance company should ensure that the spread is fully broken down into the different components (i.e. credit risk) and only the illiquidity credit should be used for the reserving adjustment.

- Restriction on the size of the illiquidity premium by duration i.e. lower over shorter durations and higher over longer durations.

- Restriction on the size of the illiquidity premium by credit rating of the underlying backing assets i.e. lower for poorly rated assets.

- The size of the illiquidity premium should be supported by historical data/experience that has been carried out by company.

- The insurance company may be required to carry out sensitivity testing on the illiquidity premium assumption and disclose the results to the regulator.

- The capital requirement for interest rate risk charge may increase if the illiquidity premium has been allowed for in the liability calculation.

- The illiquidity premium used for the liability calculation should be consistent with the assumption used in determining the premium.

- The illiquidity premium should be reconsidered and updated regularly.

- The illiquidity premium may only be taken into account where the backing assets match the nature, term, currency and amounts of the projected liability cashflows, and where liability cashflows are fairly predictable.

- The use of the illiquidity premium may only be permitted in times of general illiquidity in the corporate bond market; i.e. the illiquidity premium should only be permitted where a similar premium can be identified on the asset side.

- The insurance company should have in place risk management systems and investment policy provisions specifically oriented to the risks inherent to the application of an illiquidity premium, including liquidity risks.

small) will have unpredictable cashflows and will not be able to make use of an illiquidity premium, assuming that these premiums can even be calculated in a developing country. The premium basis is unlikely to be useful in calculating market-consistent liabilities, and a number of candidates mentioned that the value of future premiums should be included in calculating the liabilities.
In part (ii) many candidates did not comment on the proposal as asked, but instead commented on the investment merits of infrastructure bonds, and some even thought that such assets might not be easily available to the insurer, despite the question stating that these assets are backing the liabilities (and therefore they have already been acquired).
In part (iii) answers were generally very brief, reflecting a lack of deep thinking and application of bookwork knowledge.

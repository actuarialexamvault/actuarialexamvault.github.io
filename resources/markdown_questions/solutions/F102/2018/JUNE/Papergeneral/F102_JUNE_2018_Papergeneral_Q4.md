## QUESTION 4

i. Advantages:

- The product is very simple to understand and explain.

- This simplicity means that it should be able to be sold fairly easily through a call centre.

- It covers the benefit that accounts for a significant proportion of all critical illness claims, particularly for females.

- It will be cheaper than the comprehensive product, all other things being equal, and thus attractive to customers in terms of affordability.

- It should be simple to underwrite as there is less scope for anti-selection (with the insurer initiating the sale).

- You will have some data to base the pricing on.

- Cancer is a well-known and documented illness that is perceived to be risky to the public.

- If the product is innovative it might help improve sales, or the company's reputation.

- It should be (slightly) simpler to do the claims assessment. Disadvantages:

- People may misunderstand the product, thinking it covers more than just cancer, leading to reputational issues.

- It may damage the sales of your existing product.

- If you do not already have a call centre, it will take significant time, and money, to get this going.

- You will need to amend your claims and underwriting processes.

ii. Assumption setting:

- The key assumption is the cancer incidence rate

- Data from your existing product will assist in setting the assumption.

- You will need to adjust the experience rate to allow for the different underwriting process, which will probably be less rigorous, so assume a higher incidence rate.

- Adjust for the fact that there may be some anti-selection, that is, people who are worried about getting cancer will be more likely to choose this product.

- The expense assumption is key, and although a portion of this can be estimated from your existing product, you will need to allow for the specific costs of setting up and running the call centre.

- You should also consider that some of the expenses may be lower, e.g. less senior underwriting and claims resources needed

- Some expenses may be higher, e.g. significant costs needed to market this product.

- The lapse assumption is crucial and it is likely to be significantly different from your existing product, as the distribution channel is so different.

- Your investment and risk discount rates will be broadly similar to what you use for the existing product, perhaps with a slightly higher risk discount rate to allow for the uncertainty.

- The profit margin could be similar to that for the current product, but may be slightly higher due to this being a new product and hence more risky.

- You will probably need to involve reinsurers which have experience in this market.

iii. Risk mitigation:

- Limit the maximum sum insured that you offer.

- Offer a term product, rather than whole of life, or a shorter term than for the comprehensive product.

- Do not guarantee the premium rates.

- Reinsure a significant portion of the new product, until you have credible experience.

- Add an extra profit margin

- However, the product will still need to be competitive.

- Limit the number of policies you sell. This can only be crudely managed by adjusting marketing spend.

- Ensure that you have a very quick feedback loop on the claims experience.

- Ensure you have the ability to monitor the experience by the relevant factors, e.g. call centre location, or agent.

- Use longer waiting periods to reduce anti-selection.

The answers to part (ii) were often too generic, with candidates not giving sufficient attention to the particular product.
Part (iii) was generally poorly answered. Many candidates did not even get some of the more obvious points. Many candidates overlooked the complications of selling through a call centre.
For example, "stricter underwriting" is not a feasible option.
Several candidates appeared not to understand the basic constructs of critical illness insurance, as they mentioned mortality and recovery rates and the cost of medical treatment.
This is a very poor mistake for candidates at this level.

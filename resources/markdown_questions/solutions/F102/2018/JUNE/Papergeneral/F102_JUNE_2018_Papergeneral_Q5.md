## QUESTION 5

i. Determining the per policy expenses:
Allocation of costs to unit-linked business:

- Commission would usually not be included in the expense investigation as it is proportionate to the premiums received.

- Marketing costs can be allocated directly to the unit-linked product.

- Staff costs:

- For the salaries in the relevant departments the insurer will perform a review of the time spent by the relevant departments on the tasks:

- Inception of new policies, partial surrenders, surrenders, death claims, maturity claims, fund switches.

- Time sheets may be required showing time spent on each activity for the unitlinked product.

- The once-off cost of the new administration system will need to be allocated to the unit-linked product.

- This could be amortised over time based on the expected useful lifetime of the system.

- Other once-off costs will be dealt with using a similar approach.

- Indirect costs, e.g. property costs, may be allocated using the floor space used by each department and then allocated in accordance with salaries.

- Overheads, e.g. compliance, will need to be separately identified.

- Rules for allocating overhead costs will need to be determined.

- Investment expenses (investment department, commission etc.) for the internal funds will be allocated to each fund. Allocating expenses per policy:

- To determine per policy expenses the insurer will need to consider:

- expenses relating to new business relative to the number of new policies;

- on-going expenses relative to the number of policies in force; and

- termination expenses relative to the number of terminations.

ii. Appropriate model points for existing business and expected new business will need to be
selected for the model.
For each model point project the unit fund using expected investment returns on the unitfund.
Allow for tax.
Take the investment mix of the investment funds and proportion of policies for each investment fund into account.
Take cashflows for the unit-fund into account (premiums, payments for partial withdrawals, surrenders, deaths and maturity).
Project the cashflows for the non-unit fund (charges and expenses).
Allow for any reserving solvency requirements on the non-unit fund.
Monthly cashflow projections should be used for accuracy of the results.
Assumptions for partial withdrawals, surrenders and deaths will be set on a best-estimate basis.
Investment returns may be modelled stochastically.
Other cashflows are likely to be modelled deterministically.
Allow for any relationships between parameters, for example the relationship between investment returns and expense inflation should be consistent.
Discount the charges less expenses and increase in reserves for each time period.
Use an appropriate risk discount rate that reflects the return required by the insurer and the level of risk related to the net cashflows.
Charges will be set so that the insurer achieves its profit target.
Take the variability of the outcomes of investment returns and sensitivity of the results to individual assumptions into account.
The net cashflow from each model point will be scaled up to reflect business volumes.
A large number of simulations will be required to get a distribution of outcomes for the stochastic model of investment returns.
The insurer may select the mean outcome of investment returns or possibly a point on the distribution allowing for some prudence in the projected unit fund values.
The insurer may investigate the effect of different parameter values to determine the sensitivity of the adequacy of the charges to these parameter values (e.g. withdrawals), and to changes in assumptions of business volumes and business mix.

iii. The insurer will need to consider:

- The extent to which such increases meet policyholder reasonable expectations.

- Whether such increases would lead to an increase in surrenders.

- Charges in the rest of the market.

- The potential impact on new business volumes, particularly if higher than those on competitors' products.

- The extent to which such reviewability of charges was made known to policyholders at the point of sale.

- The impact on the insurer's reputation. In general, performance was very poor for this question. Candidates failed to apply their knowledge to the specifics asked within the question. While the majority of candidates appeared to know the relevant theory, many did not read the question carefully and answer what was asked. In part (i) many candidates provided generic answers, and failed to include the specifics of the given product and situation such as the new administration system. Furthermore, only a few candidates actually finished describing how to go about calculating per policy expenses, namely dividing either by expected business volumes, in force policies or terminating policies (depending on timing of expenses). In part (ii) performance was slightly better than on part (i). However, few candidates mentioned tax or non-unit reserving requirements and most failed to distinguish between the unit and nonunit funds in the modelling process. Many candidates, however, did recognize the need for a stochastic model of investment returns and the need for dynamic linking and consistency of variables. Performance on part (iii) was slightly better. Surprisingly few candidates mentioned lapses and new business volumes, or reputational impacts and communication with policyholders.

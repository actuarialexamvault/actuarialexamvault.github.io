## QUESTION 6

i. Examples of regulations:

- Maximum limit applied to asset classes (including derivatives), currencies, domicile.

- Maximum limit applied to individual assets/investments.

- Maximum limits applied to assets/asset classes for purposes of demonstrating solvency.

- Minimum prescribed holding in specific assets, asset classes, currencies, domicile.

- Maximum limit applied to counterparties (to limit credit risk).

- Maximum duration on bond portfolios.

- Minimum credit rating .

- The requirement to hold a mismatching reserve.

- Liquidity requirements.

- Restrict the use of derivatives (e.g. only for matching purposes).

- Prescribed methodology for calculating asset values (fair value).

- Require independent custodian.

ii. Investments for the annuities:

- Nature of the benefits: the instalments are guaranteed in terms of the CPI index.

- Nature of future expenses: these are likely to be real and likely to be between CPI and salary inflation, however this depends on the company's efficiency and cost control.

- Term of benefits and expenses: this depends on the types of annuity and annuitant profile, however for life annuities the average outstanding term could be many years.

- Currency: likely to be local currency for both benefits and expenses.

- Liabilities could be uncertain due to:

- Mortality/longevity fluctuations (although for a large annuity portfolio, mortality fluctuations should be relatively small and benefit outgo quite predictable).

- Suitable assets should include those whose returns are guaranteed or expected to increase in line with CPI:

- CPI linked government bonds provide a 'risk-free' return to the insurer; however these might not be available in a developing country (or in sufficient quantity or of desirable terms), and the CPI guaranteed return is only available if held to maturity.

- Equity and property are expected to generate returns of at least CPI, however over short to medium term the market values can be volatile, although their income streams less so.

- Equity and property are most suitable for matching future expenses to the extent that expense inflation might exceed CPI.

- Short-term index linked liabilities could be matched by fixed interest stocks, to the extent that expected return includes an allowance for expected CPI, and deviations of actual CPI from expected are not likely to be significant over short terms.

- Offshore assets might provide some protection against unexpected CPI increases (to the extent that these may be due to a weakening currency), however the link is loose and currency risk might be too high to absorb.

- If the insurer is small, its equity and property exposure is better gained through collective investment vehicles to obtain adequate diversification.

- While the insurer will first consider its matching assets, there might be scope to deviate from a matched position (to maximise shareholder returns) if the free reserves are large enough.

iii. Equity-linked annuity:

- The assets should be invested to match the equity index, hence bonds are unsuitable.

- The insurer could try to replicate the index by purchasing all the stocks of the index, however this will be impractical for a number of reasons:

- High transaction costs of frequent trading would result in the insurer's returns being lower than those required.

- Purchasing and selling stocks at the same time as all other investors tracking the index would shift prices and make it difficult for the insurer to generate the required return.

- Annuity inflows and outflows must be invested/disinvested in line with the index, and this may be impractical for small amounts.

- The insurer could adopt strategies used by specialist companies that track the index (e.g. use quantitative techniques to build a proxy portfolio that is easier to track), however implementation of these methods requires expertise that the company might not have.

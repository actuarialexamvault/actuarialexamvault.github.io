## QUESTION 7

i. Assumptions:

- The probability that the option will be exercised, at each possible exercise date.

- The additional benefit level that will be chosen, if this is at the discretion of the policyholder.

- The expected mortality of the lives who choose to exercise the option.

- The expected mortality of the lives who choose not to exercise the option.

- Additional expenses relating to the option.

ii. Mortality risk:

- The company is exposed to the risk that more deaths than expected occur when the guaranteed minimum death benefit exceeds the unit fund.

- The exposure depends on the amount by which the death benefit exceeds the unit fund.

- The risk is greatest when the unit fund is low, for example:

- At the start of the policy; or

- If investment returns are poor.

- Full medical underwriting will help reduce the mortality and anti-selection risk at outset.

- However, the company is exposed to anti-selection at the five year anniversary.

- The risk is that only lives in relatively poor health take up the option.

- The mortality risk relating to the option is also likely to increase if the take-up rate of the option is lower than expected, owing to increased variability and antiselection.

- If selective withdrawals from healthy lives are more than expected this would also pose a mortality risk.

- The extent of the mortality risk depends on the degree to which mortality charges may be varied by the insurer.

- The risk is also dependent on the experience the insurer has regarding mortality and the exercising of such options.

iii. Residual non-mortality risks:
Expense risk:

- The risk is that expense charges are inadequate to cover the cost of outsourcing the administration and other expenses such as overheads.

- The outsourcing agreement has reduced the company's exposure to expense risk, but there is still residual expense risk to which it is exposed.

- The company is exposed to the risk that the administration company cannot continue to administer the business, i.e. exposed to credit risk.

- If this happens the company might incur the following costs:

- An increase in ongoing costs if administration cannot be sourced at the same costs as those guaranteed under the current outsourcing agreement.

- It could also suffer reputational damage.

- In addition to administration expenses the company also incurs overhead expenses on this product and it is still exposed to the risk that these expenses are higher than expected.

- The company is also exposed to inflation risk on these overhead expenses.

- The extent of this risk will depend on the variability of the expense charges. Investment risk:

- The majority of the investment risk is passed on to policyholders due to the linked nature of the product.

- The matching of the guarantee reduces investment risk, but there is still residual exposure to investment risk.

- The company is exposed to the credit risk on the counterparty of the derivative instruments used to match the guaranteed maturity value.

- If the match is not perfect the company will still be exposed to some residual investment risk from the guarantee.

- Also, if investment returns are lower than expected the company is exposed to the following risks:

- Income from unit fund charges is lower than expected.

- If charges are related to investment performance there is a risk that poorer than expected investment performance results in charges being insufficient to cover expenses.

- Poor investment performance could lead to reputational damage.

- Reputational damage could affect both new business levels and surrender rates.

- Poor investment returns increase the mortality risk, as the sum at risk increases when unit funds are low.

- The company is still exposed to the risk of investment returns being lower than expected on non-unit reserves. Other risks that are not removed by the company's risk mitigation measures include:

- Risk of being uncompetitive and selling less business than expected.

- Risk of more withdrawals than expected when asset shares are negative (early durations) or below surrender values (penalties inadequate to recoup initial expenses).

- More withdrawals than expected, or lower new business than expected, will mean the overhead expenses may not be recouped.

- Risk of suffering large new business strains due to business volumes being much higher than expected.

- Risk of losses due to data errors, e.g. in pricing the option.

- Unit pricing risk.

- Risk of marketing the product to the wrong market, marketing not being done effectively or mis-selling.

- Risk of losses due to regulatory or taxation changes which increase costs or administrative requirements. Part (i) was not answered as well as it should have been by many candidates. Many gave answers which were too brief, e.g. "mortality", "take up rate" etc. Some candidates did not seem to understand what an assumption is. Part (ii) could have been answered better by most candidates. Many were not precise enough with their answers to convince the examiner that they understood the points. Part (iii) was answered reasonably well by the better prepared candidates. However, many candidates made loose and imprecise statements, leading to a loss of marks. Many candidates also failed to focus on the main risks (for which most marks were available).

## QUESTION 1

i.
The level term life policy provides for the financial needs of the family in the event of death of the policyholder while the children are still of school going age.
Term life cover is provided at lower cost for the same level of benefit than other products that could also meet this financial need (e.g. whole life cover).
A low cost product is particularly important for young families where disposable income is low.
The option to extend the term of the cover for a further five years provides an additional benefit without the concern of additional underwriting if the insured's health has deteriorated, which allows for an extension of the term if the child has not yet finished school or is pursuing further education ii.
The insurer is exposed to the following risks:

- Mortality experience e is worse than expected; this is the main risk of the policy.

- Anti-selection at the start of the policy and at the date of exercise of the option to extend the term of the contract.

- These risks may result in the additional premium for the option to extend the policy being insufficient to meet the actual costs of the option.

- Selective withdrawals since healthy lives may withdraw to get a cheaper policy with no option, especially if the loading for the option is high.

- Early withdrawal at times when the asset share is negative.

- Expense risk can be substantial, as the premiums are relatively small.

- Expense inflation may be higher than expected.

- There is some concentration risk, since one death or event, might trigger multiple policies.

- Given the low level of reserves, investment risk is minimal.

- New business volumes and/or mix risk. iii. The following items would appear in a cashflow model a.

- Option up-take

- Mortality rates before and after option take up

- Benefit levels

- Expenses relating to administering the option

- Premium rates on standard lives at time of exercising the option

- Withdrawal rates

b.
Stochastic projections allow a probability distribution function to be assigned to future unknown parameters in particular take-up rates and mortality rates after the extension of the contract.
An understanding of the variation in results (with probabilities attached) might be useful to assess the cost of the option through a distribution of results, which also allows the life insurer to set the premium at various levels of prudence.
In a stochastic model the interaction between variables can be explicitly included, enabling the effect of the interactions to be assessed. For example lower take-up rates would imply worse mortality.
But stochastic models are relatively complex.
Results are sensitive to:

- the distribution chosen

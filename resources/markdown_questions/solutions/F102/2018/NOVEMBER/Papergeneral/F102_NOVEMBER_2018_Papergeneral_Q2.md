## QUESTION 2

i.
Underwriting can help by:

- Protecting the insurer against anti-selection.

- Identifying the lives with substandard health risk.

- Identifying special terms to offer to the substandard risks.

- Helping ensure that all risks are rated equitably.

- Helping ensure that mortality experience is consistent with the pricing basis.

- Reducing the risk from over-insurance (through financial underwriting).

- Can also assist with claims underwriting to make sure only valid claims are paid. ii. Simplified underwriting, relative to stringent underwriting:

- The majority of the underwriting will be done from the application form and underwriting questionnaire.

- The underwriting could be done over the telephone. This would replace part/all of the questionnaire.

- No medical tests would be required - unless something on the questionnaire suggests that tests are required.

- No visit to a medical specialist (nurse or doctor) for a check-up would be required

- unless something on the questionnaire suggests this is required.

- Very limited financial underwriting, perhaps just stating income, or a salary slip to prove income (although the latter is rare in South Africa).

- There are likely to be more accept/decline cases, and less specially rated cases or cases with exclusions. iii. Stringent medical and financial underwriting may be a barrier to making sales, because:

- It slows the process down, which may result in the policyholder not completing the process, or going with another insurer which has a quicker process.

- The broker is also more likely to suggest an insurer that has a simpler and/or faster underwriting process.

- People often do not want to be subjected to the hassle/inconvenience of medical tests and many questions.

- If there is financial underwriting, people may not want to provide details of their earnings, or assets and liabilities.

- The more stringent the process, the more likely the insurer is to find something wrong, and hence load or decline the case. There are costs associated with stringent underwriting, and a more simplified approach could result in significant cost savings to the company. For example:

- Fewer medical tests.

- Less time spent by the underwriters.

- Lower administration cost.

iv.
The company could enter into a quota share reinsurance arrangement.
This will:

- Allow a sharing of the mortality losses (if any).

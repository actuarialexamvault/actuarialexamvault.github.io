## QUESTION 3

i.
Possible reasons for the higher than anticipated incidence rates:

- The pricing basis may have been based on incorrect data. The company may have had little data for pricing during those years, and therefore failed to account properly for claims incidence.

- The company may have modelled critical incidence claims incidence incorrectly. For example, interactions between risk events may have been modelled incorrectly. Given that these products were new at the time, and Dreadsure may have had no experience in pricing the product.

- The policy definitions may have been too loose and inconsistent with what was assumed when pricing. Resulting in more claims than expected due to court decisions in favour of the policyholder

- The underwriting process may have failed to properly control the risk being brought onto the books during the early stages of offering the product. Exposing the insurer to anti-selection.

- Advances in medical technology may have improved the identification and diagnosis of critical illnesses. This means that more cases are diagnosed prior to patients' death - leading to more claims.

iii.
Possible impact:

- There will be a change in the cancer claim inception rate.

- The rate would be expected to fall significantly.

- However, the reduction will not be of the order of 75% (as calculated above) as many of the Stage 1 claims which will be excluded may arrive as Stage 2 claims in the future.

- The move will most likely result in the dissatisfaction of current policyholders.

- Policyholders many challenge the review of benefits and may claim that they were not informed about the reviewable contract clause or they had been told such reviews would only be to enhance benefits.

- The regulator may be concerned about the fair treatment of customers implication of the change.

- Particularly if the benefits are reduced and pricing of the product remains unchanged.

- Lapses on existing business are likely to increase, depend on how aware and responsive policyholders are to the changes. It is likely that policyholders managed by brokers will be the most likely to lapse, while direct marketing policyholders are the least likely to lapse. Lapses are likely to be selective, with those in worst health (who may not get cover elsewhere) remaining, resulting in worsening of claims experience.

- This may be unpopular with the distribution channel(s).

- The product may become less competitive compared to other products in the market.

- This will damage new business being written.

- It is likely to damage Dreadsure's reputation in the market, particularly if this is not something being done by other insurers in the market.

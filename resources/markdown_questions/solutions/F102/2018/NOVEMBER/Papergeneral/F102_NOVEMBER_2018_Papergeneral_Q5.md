## QUESTION 5

i.
The insurer will determine cash bonuses as follows:

- The insurer will sub-divide the book of with-profits policies into homogenous groups with similar features.

- It will then assess the actual experience of each group of policies and compare that to the expected experience.

- This will identify what the sources of surplus were for each group of policies, and allow the insurer to attribute mortality, investment and expense profits directly to the groups of policies on which they arise.

- In determining a final dividend for each group of policies, the insurer may decide to retain some profit for smoothing purposes or to improve the solvency position.

ii.
The change in approach will have to be carefully considered in the light of contractual obligations towards existing policyholders.
Possible advantages:

- The use of terminal bonuses, as opposed to fully distributing all surplus each year through a cash dividend, will improve the solvency position of the insurer.

- It may also assist the insurer in following a less constrained investment policy, which may improve returns under these policies.

- The insurer will be able to enhance the smoothing of bonuses, which may better fit the needs of some policyholders.

- Bonuses will now relate more directly to benefits and clients may feel that they better understand what to expect from policy benefits.

- The change in approach may make the policies and their benefits more comparable with competitor products.

- Policyholders may be trying to save for a specific goal and bonuses that accumulate to maturity (as opposed to paying out in cash each year) may suit their objective better.

- Reversionary bonus levels and ultimately maturity benefits may seem bigger to policyholders in relation to the cash bonuses that can be afforded for a similar premium and experience under both approaches, which may help to enhance new business volumes.

- The new approach may be simpler and less costly to administer. Possible disadvantages:

- The change will defer the sharing of bonuses with a policyholder, which may be perceived as less favourable for policyholders than the previous practice.

- Policyholders may not value the increased death cover benefits and may have purchased these policies specifically for the annual cash dividend and may now not be able to meet their objectives.

- Policyholders may feel that the new approach is less fair than the current method.

- It is a material change in approach and existing policyholders may feel that their reasonable expectations are not being met.

- For this reason the insurer may have to apply the change in approach only to new policies from a certain date and continue existing policies under the old approach.

- As a mutual insurer, under the new approach, the insurer will lose its ability to pay an annual dividend to policyholders and may lose favour with potential customers when compared to proprietary insurance company competitors.

iii.
It may face the following challenges:

- Bonus declarations will have to be reasonable given policyholder reasonable expectations created through policy contracts and marketing material.

- Policyholders will expect real returns under these policies, which are normally obtained through investments in equity and property. Given the recent investment performance of these two asset classes, it may be a challenge to obtain real returns over certain durations.

- Given the volatility of returns from equity and property, it will be a challenge to smooth bonuses, especially annual reversionary bonuses.

- It may be difficult to initially determine a suitable bonus level and the sustainability of reversionary bonus rates may come under pressure.

- Under these conditions, the insurer may want to make more use of terminal bonuses, which will make final policy benefits less certain for policyholders.

- This may lead to reduced new business volumes compared to competitors that provide more guaranteed type savings products.

- Terminal bonuses may even need to be negative in some cases.

- The volatility of returns will cause large fluctuations in the earned asset shares of these policies from one year to the next. This will lead to increased capital requirements, making these policies either less profitable to the insurer or providing less value for money to the policyholder.

- Policyholder confidence in the product may fall, leading to higher withdrawal rates.

- The policyholders may perceive surre nder values to be unfair or too volatile.

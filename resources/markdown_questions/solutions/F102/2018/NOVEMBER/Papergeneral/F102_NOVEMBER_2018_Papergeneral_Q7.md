## QUESTION 7

i.
The liability characteristics and the most suitable matching assets:

- Income Protection (IP) pays a regular income, usually to retirement age, to an insured who becomes unable to work due to illness or accident.

- The term of the liabilities depends on the policyholder age profile. It is likely to be medium- to long-term (e.g. up to 30 years for a young insured). There is unlikely to be a surrender value on without-profits IP (which would have reduced the term of the liabilities).

- The nature of the benefit (and hence matching assets) depends on the policy conditions. Benefits can either be fixed (level or fixed increase) or linked to an index (prices or wages).

- Fixed benefits are best matched by: fixed interest stocks of suitable term, probably government-issued; corporate issued stocks can increase the expected return through the liquidity premium if stocks can be held to maturity, however the extent to which credit risk can be accepted depends on a number of factors e.g. solvency level and risk tolerance.

- Index-linked benefits (linked to price inflation) are best matched by CPI-linked bonds.

- Index-linked benefits (linked to wage inflation) are best matched by a basket of high-quality real-return assets e.g. property and equities. However, there is a risk of needing to sell assets at inopportune times due to short-term asset volatility.

- The extent of index linkage may differ for benefits out of claim and within claim, and the asset mix must reflect this.

- The nature of the insurance company's expenses are likely to be real (linked to wages) due to staff costs.

- Hence real type assets (index-linked bonds, property and equity) are suitable.

- The currency of the liabilities depends on policy conditions. Policies usually pay IP benefits in a foreign country if the insured is working in that country at the time of claim event.

- The insurer should invest in the same currency as the liabilities for a matched position.

- The variability of experience depends on target market, location and policy conditions, which can make the experience uncertain and variable.

ii.
The cause(s) of the reducing solvency level should be investigated:

- One (and possibly the main) cause will be new business strain from strong sales growth. Changing investment strategy in this case is not likely to have much impact, and at best might only delay insolvency. The insurer may need to find alternative sources of capital or alternatively reduce sales growth and/or sell a less capital-intensive product.

- The uncertainties and guarantees of a without-profits IP product are likely to result in relatively high capital requirements. Reducing the level of guarantees e.g. making the premiums reviewable, may help reduce new business strain.

- The insurer should satisfy itself that the expected deterioration in the solvency position is not due to an inadequately priced product (and that strong sales growth may be due to this) leading to projected losses.

- Expense inefficiencies might contribute to the reducing solvency level, and changing investments may not have enough impact to offset this. The director is correct in that property and equity returns are normally expected to be higher than other asset classes, However the suggestion may have limited effect:

- If the benefits are index-linked (in particular to wages), the asset mix may already include property and equities as matching assets.

- While these asset classes may be expected to produce higher returns than other assets, they can also experience higher short-term volatility.

- This volatility may require higher capital requirements may lead to a higher chance of insolvency. Other issues to consider

- Rental income from property may provide regular cashflows to support regular income protection benefit payments, but cashflows from equities may not provide a suitable match.

- Property and equity are not a suitable match for short-dated liabilities or for fixed liabilities - this increases the liquidity risk of the insurer.

- The mismatch created increases insolvency risk and is likely to lead to higher capital requirements.

- The insurer will need to hold a minimum level of liquid money market investments as working capital and to meet short-term claims and expenses.

- Direct property investment is very illiquid and only the largest insurance companies could achieve acceptable diversification, and hence indirect investment is likely to be more suitable.

iii.
If the director's intention is to increase mismatch risk in order to maximise shareholder returns, then this might be acceptable provided:

- Higher mismatch reserves or capital requirements resulting from higher risk investments do not negate the benefit of higher returns from property and equity.

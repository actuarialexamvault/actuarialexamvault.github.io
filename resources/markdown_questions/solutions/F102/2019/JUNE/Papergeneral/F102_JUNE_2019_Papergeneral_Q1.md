## QUESTION 1

i. Importance of monitoring aspects of new business sales:
General:

- May be required by the regulator as part of ongoing monitoring.

- To provide management with information, such as trends in sales/mix, to assist in strategic decision making.

- To enable the insurer to compare actual sales experience to that expected. This is particularly important for a new company, as estimates of sales/mix etc. will be an important component of the pricing assumptions and the company will not have much experience in this regard.

- Feedback into the actuarial control cycle will be of particular relevance to this relatively inexperienced company.

- Information on sales will be needed for the reserving process. Reasons relating to specific aspects of sales:

- New business volumes:

- If volumes are lower than anticipated profits are likely to be lower than anticipated.

- It may also invalidate assumptions relating to per policy expense loadings.

- If the volume of new business is much higher than anticipated this may introduce a risk of not having enough capital/financial resources to finance the new business strain.

- This is of particular importance to a relatively new company which may not have large resources.

- Operationally there is also a risk that the level of service being offered to clients and intermediaries may deteriorate as a result of high volumes of sales.

- Functions such as underwriting may also suffer if sales volumes are too high.

- This can lead to future mortality experience being worse than expected.

- This is exacerbated as the company sells mainly protection policies.

- It will be important to compare new business volumes with those of competitors to ascertain growth in market share.

- It can help assess the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

- It may be used to assist with executive remuneration based on sales volumes.

- To ascertain commissions and the effectiveness of the distribution channels.

- Nature/type of business:

- This is important to monitor since supervisory reserves will depend on the nature/type of business sold.

- Whole of life cover tends to require more supervisory reserves than term assurance.

- Average size of policies:

- If policies are larger than expected new business strain could be higher than expected.

- If policies are smaller than expected then expenses may not be adequately recouped.

- This risk is related to the extent of cross-subsidisation between large and small policies.

- The average size of policies may give an indication of the need for reinsurance.

- Source of business:

- To compare the effectiveness of the call centre compared to the broker distribution channels.

- To determine the effectiveness of specific sales agents.

- Experience for the call centre is likely to be different to that of the brokers.

- This is likely to be particularly so with mortality and persistency.

- If such differences are allowed for through differential pricing then the risk is reduced.

- Monitoring of the take-up rate of quotations can be a useful indicator of the effectiveness of sales staff.

- It could give an indication of whether the appropriate target markets are being reached.

ii. Ways of reducing the risk:

- Limit the total amount of sum assured available (initial plus option).

- Restrict the term of the carrier contracts.

- Limit the time available during which the option needs to be exercised.

- Ensure that any exclusions on the carrier contract also apply to the option contract.

- Encourage all policyholders to take up the option, e.g. through reminder notices / automatic take-up, to reduce anti-selection.

- Keep the additional premiums required in respect of the option contract low (to help achieve the last objective), although normal minimum premiums should still apply.

- Do not guarantee the premiums that will be offered on the option contract.

- Underwrite initially as though the option will be exercised (i.e. more strictly).

- Carry out financial underwriting to detect any possible over-insurance.

- Price conservatively initially.

- Arrange for a suitable reinsurance treaty.

In part (ii) several candidates did not focus specifically on ways to reduce the mortality risk "associated with this option". Some wasted time explaining what the risks of the option were, which was not asked.

## QUESTION 2

i. Setting the mortality assumptions:

- The mortality rates will be set in two parts by considering:

- The base mortality, and

- The mortality trend. Base Mortality:

- The values assigned should reflect the expected future experience of lives taking out the contracts. This should take into account:

- The target market of the insurer.

- The underwriting controls applied.

- The expected change in experience to the point in time at which the assumptions will on average apply.

- The estimates should be based on an adjustment to rates from a standard mortality table.

- The company has a significant amount of past data, and therefore would use this to set the adjustment for each product offered.

- The data would relate to an appropriate number of years, such that the volume of data is adequate without introducing excessive heterogeneity.

- The effect of any once-off or unusual events such as catastrophes would be removed.

- The data would be divided into homogenous groups per risk cell, ensuring that adequate credibility is retained within each cell.

- The pricing actuary can supplement the data with data sources such as:

- Industry-wide mortality investigations.

- Population mortality statistics.

- Reinsurance company data. Mortality Trends:

- The actuary should account for expected changes in the mortality rates over time.

- Where the insurer offers guaranteed premiums, this assumption becomes more important.

- The future mortality improvement can be determined by:

- The expectation approach - which involves expert opinion and subjective judgement.

- Explanatory approaches - which involve projecting trends in mortality rates from a bio-medical perspective.

- The actuary may model mortality improvements by year of birth.

- This allows the actuary to allow for specific causes which may affect mortality trends in each cohort.

- The mortality improvement can be modelled deterministically.

- Alternatively, multi-factor predictive models (GLMs) could be used, which combine the internally held data with external drivers.

- The actuary can also utilise stochastic mortality projections such as the Lee-Carter or P-spline method.

- These models generate many different improvement rate scenarios

- The models can, however, be challenging to calibrate.

ii. Likely impact on Foresure's new and existing business:

- Under the new ruling, the premium differential between healthy and unhealthy lives would be removed.

- This means that healthier lives will now pay more, while unhealthy lives will pay less for assurance premiums.

- Existing business would have been accepted on rates that utilised medical underwriting.

- Therefore, unhealthy lives would have been accepted at a higher premium than healthy lives.

- Unhealthy lives may lapse their policies and rejoin at new rates without loadings.

- Healthier lives have no incentive to lapse their products, and are likely to stay.

- Over the short term this is likely to result in a decrease in premium income

- New business will be based on premiums that cannot be loaded for risk based on medical underwriting.

- Therefore, there could be a short term surge of new business from unhealthy lives that need cover.

- This may result in new business strain.

- This is especially so given that the insurer will need to increase its reserves to account for the higher risk profile of the new business going forward, as well as reserving for the new business.

- The insurer may experience a slow-down in business from healthier lives, as the premiums are now more expensive.

iii. The effect on the mortality experience of Forsure:

- This ruling removes the main tool for underwriting - medical reports, and opens all insurers up to anti-selection.

- The anti-selection will be present across all insurers, not just Forsure.

- It will now be possible for unhealthy lives and high risk lives to take out policies without medical underwriting.

- Over the short-term:

- Lives that are currently sick and in need of cover will effect life cover immediately, likely resulting in a short-term spike in mortality rates.

- There will be increased volatility in mortality experience.

- Over the medium-term:

- Over time, higher risk individuals in poor health will take out life cover as their health fails and their need for cover increases.

- This means that over the medium-term there is likely to be a rise in mortality rates as the system absorbs the higher risk individuals.

- As the insurer gains an understanding of proxy rating factors and the expected mortality experience, the mortality experience should start to stabilize.

- Over the longer-term:

- Mortality rates may continue along the same trends, albeit starting from the new higher base.

- By this time, the insurer should have gained enough data and experience to price their products in light of the change in underwriting - leading to a stabilized mortality experience.

iv. Forsure could:

- Implement, or increase waiting periods on death as a result of pre-existing conditions or illness.

- Implement exclusions on pre-existing conditions [note that the insurer may still do medical underwriting, although it may not utilize the information for setting premiums].

- Implement no-claims discounts or cash-back on survival to a certain term.

- Implement new rating factors which are a proxy for health such as rating on level of physical activity.

- Targeted marketing to lives which are expected to be healthy based on location, affinity group or occupation.

In part (iv) candidates generally gave too few points to score well. Many candidates used the example of encouraging better health through a healthy lifestyle rewards programme however, this does not directly address the problem of attracting healthier lives to the business as it primarily addresses changing the behaviour of existing policyholders.

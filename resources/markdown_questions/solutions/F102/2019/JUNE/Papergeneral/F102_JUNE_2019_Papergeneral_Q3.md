## QUESTION 3

i. Factors to be considered:

- The onerousness of the targeted return of 2% p.a. compared to expected returns for various asset classes:

- In a very low-inflation environment where expected inflation is close to, or less than 2%p.a., this could represent an onerous task, requiring real growth assets to match this target with considerable risk that it cannot be met.

- In a high inflation environment where expected inflation is much higher than 2% p.a., this becomes a less onerous task and could be achieved with less aggressive investment strategies.

- While fixed interest stocks might be useful for increasing the chances of achieving the targeted return in such a scenario, these assets (particularly longer term assets) are likely to be associated with a high risk of not meeting inflation - the insurer needs to balance expectations for inflationbeating returns (and sometimes not meeting the target) against expectations for always meeting the targeted return.

- Investments backing the unit fund would be affected by:

- Published fund investment mandate, and whether investment choice is available to the policyholder, in which case the assets for each fund must be invested according to the published mandate for the fund (e.g. local or offshore shares only).

- Investment choice seems unlikely, however, if there are strong expectations of an onerous targeted maturity benefit.

- Communication to policyholders on expected returns and the extent to which the targeted maturity benefit is expected by policyholders (even if not guaranteed) - if strong expectations exist, it would suggest that a closer targeting of the 2% p.a. return is required.

- Unless expected asset returns are considerably higher than 2% p.a. (in a high inflation environment) in which case it might not be necessary to closely match the targeted return.

- If the product is marketed and sold mainly for its life cover benefits, the maturity value may not be considered too important by policyholders.

- Expected returns assumed in determining the charging structure.

- Unit fund assets and liabilities are most likely to be matched and equal i.e. the bid price of units is based on the value of unit fund assets.

- Investments backing the non-unit fund would be affected by:

- For positive non-unit insurance liabilities:

- The term of the risk benefits depends on the expected mortality or morbidity of the policyholders (likely to be longer-term).

- Expenses comprise of regular outflow for the duration of the contract.

- These will increase with price and wage inflation.

- The term of the expense liability depends on the extent to which expense charges and costs are mismatched over time (e.g. if charges are a fixed amount per month).

- The best matching assets are likely to be:

- government or corporate bonds of appropriate term for risk benefits;

- liquid money market assets to cover on-going expenses; and possibly

- index-linked bonds for the expense reserve for longer terms.

- The extent of mismatching is influenced by the firm's risk tolerance and free reserves - higher free reserves may provide greater freedom to mismatch non-unit fund assets and liabilities.

- Regulations could affect the assets in various ways:

- Limits, exclusions, admissibility requirements.

- Mismatching reserves and/or risk-based capital requirements.

- Taxation: the insurer will wish to minimise taxes paid, and this could lead to a preference for income or capital gains and for certain classes over others.

- The company may wish to use a stochastic asset-liability model to assess how well a specific investment strategy performs in delivering on the targeted maturity value and other criteria (e.g. profitability/return on capital).

- Other points:

- The insurer will wish to minimise investment expenses.

- Aim for a well-diversified portfolio to reduce market volatility.

ii. Impact on investment strategy of adding the GMV:

- There may be no change to the investments:

- If the company has hedged the guarantee with market put options, then there may be no reason to change the investment strategy.

- If the company decides to retain the guarantee risk, and the charges adequately cover the cost of this guarantee, then again the company might not want to change the investments; however some additional considerations apply in respect of investing the investment guarantee charges:

- The investments should reflect the assumptions made in calculating the charge (e.g. if risk free interest rate, then risk free assets are needed).

- The assets that the charges are invested in should have no (or negative) correlation with the assets backing the unit fund.

- The addition of the guarantee (especially if not hedged) may increase capital requirements and the company may want to counteract this by utilising a lowerrisk investment strategy that minimizes the chances of the guarantee biting.

- This may lead to investments that have lower uncertainty of returns relative to pricing assumptions.

- Even if the guarantee is hedged it may lead to higher capital requirements (e.g. due to counterparty risk); the company may want to counteract this by using different counterparties for investments in order to reduce concentration risk. Overall this question was not answered well. In part (i) most candidates produced the standard bookwork list of points, with very little effort made to apply the points to a unit-linked product. Most candidates did not distinguish between unit fund and non-unit fund considerations. Almost no-one considered the importance of the published mandate for the unit fund, which could be based on any asset class and any region. It would be most unusual (and mostly not permitted) to mismatch unit fund assets and liabilities due to the risks of doing so (regardless of the free asset position). Almost no-one considered the onerousness of the target, and those that did usually assumed it was not onerous. A number of candidates provided points that fell far short of the instruction to "describe" the factors. In part (ii) a number of candidates provided points not relevant to the question asked which was about investment strategy, not about pricing and charging for the guarantee.

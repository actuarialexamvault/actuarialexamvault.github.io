## QUESTION 4

i. The cost of the return of premium investment guarantee is the maximum of:

- the excess of the single premium over the term of the policy over the value of the venture capital investment fund at maturity, if the value of the venture capital fund is lower than the premium; and

- zero, otherwise. The cost of the guarantee can be determined using: Option pricing techniques:

- European put option on the venture capital investment fund with exercise price of return of premiums, if available; or

- An approximation using European put options on a suitable combination of equity market indices. Stochastic simulation of investment performance:

- Projecting forward the value of the fund using a stochastic model of returns on the venture capital fund.

- This would be done using a large number of simulations.

- The probability distribution of investment returns will be best estimate and calibrated to current market conditions.

ii. Impact:

- The liability for the unit linked contract will be the sum of the unit and non-unit reserves (including the liability for the return of premium guarantee).

- Assets relative to the liability for the unit fund will not be impacted as both values will have reduced due to the fall in equity values.

- Since the liability for the unit fund is the bid value of the units multiplied by the number of units.

- The value of the liability for the non-unit fund will increase relative to the assets (which may include a number of asset classes including cash and bonds).

- The value of the non-unit reserves will increase:

- Since charges on the investment fund are expected to reduce while on-going expenses are unlikely to be impacted by the fall inequity markets.

- In addition the cost of the guarantee is likely to increase due to a fall in the unit fund value.

- If the insurer changes the assumptions for the distribution of investment returns to reflect the increased volatility of equity markets, this will result in an additional increase to the cost of the guarantee.

## QUESTION 5

i. Purpose and product features of income protection:

- The product aims to replace part of the insured's income if he/she is unable to work due to disability.

- Covers claims due to accident and/or illness.

- Benefits will be paid on temporary disability (not only permanent as is the case with lump sum disability cover).

- The benefits (a regular annuity) are paid until the insured recovers, dies or the policy term ends (usually normal retirement age).

- A number of separate benefit periods can occur without the policy ceasing.

- In some instances (although rarely) the regular income may be commutable to a lump sum.

- Benefits can escalate before claim payment commences.

- Benefits can also escalate once the claim is in payment.

- Premiums are usually level, but may also increase if the benefit is increasing.

- The benefit may include a waiver of premium benefit.

- The sum insured (annuity benefit) is set so as to avoid over-insurance.

- Several definitions of disability are possible, for example: unable to do own, any, or reasonable occupation; inability to perform certain Activities of Daily Living; Functional Assessment Test.

- A partial benefit is possible if the policyholder is able to return to work on a parttime basis.

- There is not usually any surrender or maturity benefit.

ii. Risk mitigation using reinsurance:

- This is a new product for your company so the reinsurer will be able to provide technical support.

- This will come in the form of product design, pricing, underwriting and claims management

- Reinsuring the product will allow you to share the downside of the pricing risk.

- This could arise due to parameter risk (getting incidence and termination rates wrong), or to not understanding the market, and where the economy is in the pricing cycle

- You could enter into a financial reinsurance contract which would assist your startup costs in launching this product. Types of reinsurance:

- As this is a new, and risky, product, you would probably want to enter into a fairly large quota share arrangement.

- In addition a surplus arrangement could be used to protect you from large risks.

- Catastrophe cover could be purchased, although this is not likely to be a priority.

- The level of reinsurance will be influenced by the risk appetite of the company.

- The level of the company's free reserves will also impact the extent of reinsurance sought. Downsides:

- Reinsurance comes at a cost, and the company will have to give away some of its profits if it enters into a reinsurance arrangement

- The reinsurer may insist on more stringent risk management than the insurer would like.

- E.g. stricter underwriting or claims processes

- The reinsurance processes may result in a slower service offering to the policyholder.

- This may limit the ability of the insurer to reach its growth targets.

- The insurer will have increased counterparty risk, as it is exposed to the risk of the reinsurer failing to meet its obligations. This question was a fairly standard product features and reinsurance question. Reasonably well-prepared candidates should have scored at least 8/12. Part (i) was basic bookwork, and given that there were many points which could have been made, well-prepared candidates should have scored full marks (or close to it) on this part. Common mistakes were:

- Stating that the cause of disability could be "illness or disability", rather than "illness / sickness or accident/injury".

- Outlining what the money could be used for, e.g. school fees, paying a mortgage, etc. The main purpose of the product is to replace one's salary/income. What one does with the money is almost beside the point.

- Several candidates mentioned "retrenchment", which is a completely different product. Part (ii) was an applied question, and was generally not answered well. Many answers were far too generic, e.g. describing what reinsurance is. Many candidates did not structure their answers around the specific points asked for in the question. Well-structured answers are much more likely to score well. Under the downsides, most candidates mentioned "cost" and "counterparty risk", but surprisingly few mentioned the other points.

## QUESTION 6

i. Principles to consider:

- Equity between:

- Policyholders that surrender their policies and those that do not.

- Policyholder reasonable expectations (PRE), as informed by past practice, policy contracts and marketing material.

- Affordability. The company would want to ensure that surrender values are no greater than the earned asset shares (on average over time) and are reduced for the cost of administering the surrender.

- At early durations the company would also want to consider the comparison of actual surrender values with premiums paid to date.

- At later durations, the surrender value should flow smoothly into the maturity value as the duration approaches the maturity of the policy.

- The surrender values should be compared to surrender values quoted by its competitors and auction values that may be available.

- It would want to:

- Keep the surrender value bases stable over time.

- Avoid discontinuities by duration.

- It would want to ensure that surrender values are easy to administer.

- It should be capable of being clearly and understandably conveyed to policyholders and advisers in policy documents and marketing material.

- It should avoid any forms of anti-selection against the company.

- Including Lapse-and-re-entry risks.

- Meet any regulatory restrictions that may apply.

ii. The company would most likely use the following approach:

- Using a prospective method, the surrender value (SV) would be calculated as the present value of the expected cost of benefits plus expenses over the remaining term of the policy, less the present value of the expected future premiums to be collected over the remaining term of the policy.

- The costs of administering the surrender would be deducted from this present value.

- The SV would be calculated using the company's stipulated surrender value basis.

- The profit on surrender would be determined as the excess of the earned asset share (EAS) of the policy over the calculated SV.

- There is no guarantee that the SV calculation will not exceed the EAS. The company may need to adjust SVs to prevent this from happening, on average.

- The minimum surrender benefit is zero, which means that there is always a loss on a surrender when the EAS is negative (early on in the policy term).

- If the SV basis is the same as the original premium basis, the insurance company retains the difference between the assumed experience including margins in the original premium basis and actual experience to date (historic profit).

- If the actual experience is worse than expected (incl. margins), a loss will be incurred on surrender.

- If the SV basis is a best estimate basis, the company will retain the expected present value (at the date of withdrawal) of both historic profit and future margins in the original premium basis.

iii. Surrender values for unit-linked policies:

- The contract design and the pattern of expenses incurred on the contracts will be the main factors determining:

- whether or not a surrender penalty is needed;

- to what extent a surrender penalty depends on term and duration in force; and

- the form it takes (cash amount or related to units).

- The surrender value will usually be the value of the unit fund less a surrender penalty.

- While surrender values are not likely to be guaranteed, their method of calculation is likely to be specified up-front.

- The surrender penalty should be such that initial expenses (at least) are recouped.

- If initial expenses are recouped through:

- A front-end load - then a surrender penalty may not be required.

- A reduced level allocation to units - then a non-unit surrender penalty is required.

- Units with a high management charge - the surrender penalty should be unitrelated.

- If the company wants to employ an actuarial funding technique, then a unit related surrender penalty is required.

- Surrender penalties will usually vary by contract term and duration in force, and will reduce as policies approach maturity. Answers to part (i) were generally good, with the majority of candidates getting full marks. Part (ii) was a standard bookwork question, where stronger candidates made it clear that the surrender profit is (always) equal to the difference between the EAS and the SV paid. This difference can conceptually be explained by looking at SV calculated on different bases. In discussing the historic profits, weaker answers did not make it clear that the original premium basis is used in this analysis and lost marks as a result. A number of candidates did not understand the impact of a SV basis on the SV calculated. A common error was to refer to a "surrender penalty" in this context, whereas this is a phrase applicable to unit-linked products only. Part (iii) was poorly answered, with many candidates simply repeating the general principles from part (i) of this question. The question clearly asked for considerations specifically applicable to the unit-linked product and so generic principles did not receive any credit.

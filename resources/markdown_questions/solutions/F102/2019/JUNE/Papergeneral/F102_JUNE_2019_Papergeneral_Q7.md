## QUESTION 7

i. Reasons:

- This happens because of the fact that a compound reversionary bonus approach defers the distribution of surplus more than in the case of a simple reversionary bonus.

- This distribution is further deferred through the use of terminal bonuses.

- Company B is thus expected to have:

- a lower liability guaranteed in monetary terms than Company A; and

- a reduced probability of insolvency.

- Hence:

- it should have more investment freedom; and

- can therefore invest more in potentially higher risk / higher return assets such as equities and property.

- Given the relatively long time horizon of 18 years this could reasonably be expected to result in better investment returns than the "safer" assets held by Company A, and therefore a higher expected maturity benefit.

- However, this may not always be the case because of the higher investment risk).

ii. Surplus distribution approach:

- Company C is most likely distributing surplus through a cash bonus and/or premium reduction. This is unlikely to be appropriate for the man because:

- His primary motivation for obtaining a policy is to save for a future event.

- A cash bonus or premium/reduction would pass the investment risk back to him.

iii. Other considerations:

- Assess the value for money of the two products, for example:

- Using historic bonus rates, typical maturity benefits can be calculated for R1 of premium for each of the two companies.

- Whether sources of surplus, other than investment surplus, would be included in any distribution (e.g. mortality surplus).

- The man's attitude to risk.

- The terminal bonus introduces significantly more uncertainty around the ultimate maturity value, which may be unacceptable to the man.

- Whether mortality protection is needed during the term.

- The mortality benefit could be significantly less under Company B's bonus structure (all other things being equal).

- This would be particularly so if the terminal bonus is typically significantly lower at shorter durations than longer durations.

- Attractiveness of other product features offered e.g. surrender values offered, minimum maturity guarantees, etc.

- Compare the two companies with respect to:

- Customer service the man is likely to receive.

iv. Calculations:

- In the case of Company A, assume the simple annual rate of reversionary bonus is j, then: 500 000×(1+18𝑗)=1 000 000 which yields 𝑗 = 5.56%

- In the case of Company B there is a 25% terminal bonus, where the 25% is applied to the attaching bonus only. If the compound reversionary bonus is k, then: 500 000×[ (1+𝑘)18+0.25[(1+𝑘)18-1] ]= 1 000 000 which yields 𝑘 =3.32% Part (i) was reasonably well answered. However, a common mistake was to assume that the simple reversionary bonus rate would be exactly the same as the compound reversionary bonus rate, and the accumulated value using a compound rate exceeds that using a simple rate. In part (ii) some candidates did not read the question (all products are conventional) and continued to suggest that a European-style revalorisation method or US-style contribution method would be used by Company C. Part (iii) was a challenging question. A common suggestion was to compare historic bonus rates and/or premiums. However, the two products have very different bonus distribution philosophies and as a result comparing historic bonus rates is inappropriate. Similarly, a comparison based on premiums only would be inappropriate, because the benefits for a given premium are likely to be different.

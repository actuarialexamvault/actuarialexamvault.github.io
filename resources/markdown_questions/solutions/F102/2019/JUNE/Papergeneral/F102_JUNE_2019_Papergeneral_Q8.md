## QUESTION 8

i. Guaranteed level annuity:
a. Benefits to policyholder:

- The policyholder receives a guaranteed level income for life, reducing the concern of running out of funds at older ages due to living longer than expected. b. Risks that remain with the policyholder:

- The level income may be insufficient to cover living costs at later ages if the real value of the level income is eroded by high levels of inflation.

Unit-linked "income drawdown: product: a. Benefits to policyholder:

- Any remaining funds can be transferred to the dependants of the policyholder on the death of the policyholder.

- This may appeal particularly to policyholders in poor health at the time of purchasing the product.

- The policyholder can choose the income level through altering the percentage of the unit fund encashed.

- Growth in fund assets may allow the policyholder to increase the income received as living costs increase over time. b. Risks that remain with policyholder:

- The policyholder remains exposed to longevity risks, i.e. there is a risk that the investment in the unit fund runs out before the death of the policyholder.

- The policyholder remains exposed to investment risk, asset returns may be low over an extended period or funds may need to be disinvested at times when the market has fallen.

ii. The appropriation price is the price at which a unit would be created and is determined as:

- the net asset value of the fund on an "offer basis"

- divided by the number of units existing at the time of calculation (before any new units are created) The net asset value of the fund on an "offer basis" is calculated as:

- the market "offer price" value of the assets held by the fund

- plus the expenses that would be incurred in the purchase (including stamp duty)

- plus the value of any current assets (e.g. cash on deposit)

- less the value of any current liabilities (e.g. investments purchased but not yet settled)

- plus any accrued income (e.g. interest income on deposits) net of any outgo (e.g. fund charges)

- less any allowance for accrued tax, if applicable

iii. A model can be used to determine the monthly fund management charge as follows:

- Select model points that represent the expected new business under the unit-linked "income drawdown" product.

- Obtain advice from distribution channels or carry out research to determine the expected profile of targeted policyholders for each of the three investment funds.

- Project cashflows for the unit and non-unit fund for each model point.

- Project returns on asset values and growth in fund values based on the investment strategy for the individual fund.

- Allow for monthly income disinvestments based on annual "income drawdown" percentage.

- Trial management charges based on fund values.

- Include management expenses, allowing for expense inflation.

- Allow for reserving and solvency requirements for the non-unit fund.

- Allow for expected withdrawals.

- Take expected competition and future economic conditions into account.

- Investment returns on the unit fund may be projected on a stochastic basis.

- This will require sufficient data to be available to calibrate the parameters.

- Withdrawal and mortality assumptions are likely to be set on a deterministic basis.

- Allow for the interactions between parameters (e.g. investment return and inflation).

- Net projected cashflows for the non-unit fund will be discounted at the risk discount rate.

- This should allow for the return required by the insurer and level of risk relating to the cashflows.

- Compare the discounted net cashflows with the targeted profit criterion.

- Vary the assumed charges for each model point until an acceptable level of profit is achieved for each model point.

- Scale the result based on expected business volumes for each model point.

- Consider the aggregate level of profitability for the product - cross-subsidies among model points may be allowed.

- Assess the sensitivity of the results to variations in the assumptions (e.g. variations in the percentage "income drawdown").

- Consider whether the charging structure is marketable.

- This is important since product features are standardised across the industry.

- Consider whether the charging structure is reasonable given the insurer's profit requirements, capital required to finance the product and the once-off development cost Part (i) was generally well answered by candidates, with most getting full marks or close to it. In part (ii) many candidates provided a formula and a brief list rather than following the instruction to "describe", and did not give examples where appropriate. In part (iii) it appeared as though several candidates ran out of time, as many did not provide enough detail or a sufficient number of points to score well.

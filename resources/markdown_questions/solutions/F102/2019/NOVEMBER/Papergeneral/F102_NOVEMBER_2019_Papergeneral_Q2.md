## QUESTION 2

i. The following product features would need to be specified in the design of the product:

- Nature of benefit payments: Level, increasing at a fixed rate, increasing in line with an index or some combination thereof.

- Death benefits or guarantees: For example, first 60 months payments are guaranteed.

- Spouse's reversion: Percentage of benefit amount, number of spouses covered (unlikely to offer this as a default option).

- Any enhancement for impaired mortality.

- Maximum age.

- Expense charge design.

ii. Lower than expected premium income may be due to:

- Lower than anticipated capital value of pension at the point of purchase if: Tax at retirement is higher than anticipated. Deductions from fund values at retirement exist, for example to settle a housing debt or a divorce settlement. Investment returns have been lower than anticipated prior to retirement (in the defined contribution context).

- Contributions to pension schemes may be lower than expected.

- More pension scheme members take the maximum amount in cash permitted by regulations than expected.

- Low take up of the default option because pension scheme members elect to purchase open-market annuities: Particularly members who have their own brokers and members who want a different design feature of the annuity (for example increasing vs level benefit payments). Default annuities are a new feature so more marketing may be required. Members may get better rates elsewhere.

iii. Effect of premium volumes being different than expected:

- If premium volumes are lower than expected: Profits may be lower than anticipated. Fixed expenses and development costs may not be covered. Percentage of premium charges may be inadequate. Investment freedom may be reduced.

iv. Other risks relating to the product:
Mortality and longevity:

- Mortality may be lighter than anticipated.

- This may arise due to over-estimation of base mortality or under-estimation of mortality improvements.

- The company may have little previous experience of mortality for this target market.

- Longevity risk is exacerbated by the risk of anti-selection, if members in poor health elect income draw down products.

- Guaranteed death benefits expose the insurer to the risk of higher mortality early in the policy term. Source of business:

- There is going to be a concentration by source as one would anticipate a large number of policies arising from each pension scheme.

- There may be some correlations between policyholders in terms of annuity amount and mortality early in the term. Although this is only really a downside risk if there are guarantees. Investment returns:

- Assets that match the liability may not be available, particularly if the discounted mean term is long.

- Matching assets may not be available for the benefit increase structure of the insurer.

- If following an unmatched strategy, the insurer is exposed to: Reinvestment risk; Risk that investment returns are lower than anticipated; and Movements in assets that may create solvency difficulties. Expenses:

- Base expenses may be higher than anticipated.

- Expense inflation may be higher than anticipated. Business volumes for other business:

- Business volumes on other annuity and income draw down products may be reduced.

- Particularly if brokers are angered by the introduction of a no commission product and recommend products from other insurers to customers. Competitive pressures:

- Competitive pressures to acquire the business from pension funds may encourage the insurer to reduce premium rates; or

Reinsurance/risk transfer:

- Reinsurance may not be appropriate to manage the risks.

- Longevity swap may be the preferred risk transfer measure, but may not be available.

- Reinsurer may default on its obligations. Reputational risk if product does not meet the expectations of policyholders:

- No advice is given at the sales stage of this product, so members may misunderstand the terms and conditions of the policy.

- Policyholders may select high cash lump sums resulting in low annuity payments and hence the product failing to meet their expectations.

- Inflation may erode purchasing power, resulting in reputational risk (even for an inflation-linked which typically increases annually). Fraud:

- Families may claim the pension benefit after the pensioner has died. Regulation:

## QUESTION 3

i. The reserve will be made up of two elements, a unit reserve and a non-unit reserve.
Unit reserve:

- The unit reserve would be equal to the value of the units held on the valuation date, calculated by multiplying the number of units held by the bid price of a unit on that date.

- This would ensure that, for a contract maturing on the valuation date, a unit reserve is being held sufficient to cover the maturity benefit. Non-unit reserve:

- A non-unit reserve is necessary if expenses are likely to exceed charges at any future time.

- A non-unit reserve is also necessary because there is a minimum guaranteed death benefit, of a fixed amount, that may exceed the bid value of the units. This is particularly so at early durations when the guaranteed death benefit is likely to be significantly higher than the bid value of the units.

- The non-unit reserve would be calculated by determining all the non-unit cash flows arising under each contract, allowing for decrements. These cashflows include: Unallocated premiums, mortality charges and any other charges received (for example annual management charge, bid/offer spreads etc.) Expected renewal and claims expenses Expected death benefits Any profits/losses on surrender or part-surrender

- Projected cashflows will most likely be discounted at the risk-free rate.

- If the discounted value of the projected net cashflows is negative the regulator may require the insurer to zeroise (set the present value equal to zero) on a per policy basis or on a portfolio basis.

ii. Suggested approach for reserving for the investment guarantee:

- A stochastic model would be the preferred approach to determine the reserve for any shortfalls in the value of the unit fund relative to the guaranteed minimum maturity value. Reasons why a deterministic model would be inappropriate:

- Under a deterministic model the future value of the fund may be projected using the expected level of investment returns less charges based on the expected asset allocation for the investment fund.

- The fund value projected on this basis is likely to exceed the minimum guaranteed value at maturity, resulting in a zero reserve for the investment guarantee.

range of investment outcomes to determine the reserve for an investment guarantee.
Use of a stochastic model will produce a range of outcomes of fund values based on the simulated investment returns, a number of these outcomes will reflect a shortfall in the unit fund compared to the guaranteed minimum maturity value.
Use of a stochastic model in this regard could follow the approach outlined below:

- A stochastic model would project the unit fund using many different simulated investment scenarios, where the future investment returns are governed by a probability distribution function.

- The assumptions underlying the model should reflect the investment strategy of the unit fund.

- The shortfall relating to the investment guarantee (i.e. where the fund value lower than the guaranteed minimum payment at maturity) will be determined for each investment scenario.

- The projected future shortfall may be reduced by the projected value of future charges on the unit fund relating to the investment guarantee.

- The present value of the shortfall can be determined by discounting the projected shortfalls at a suitable discount rate.

- The probability of the policy maturing should be taken into account through relevant decrements (for example mortality and withdrawals).

- Repeated simulation (1000s of simulations) will generate the probability distribution of outcomes for the reserves for the investment guarantee.

- The reserve for the investment guarantee could be set as the expected (i.e. average) present value of the simulated outcomes.

- If more prudence is required at point on the distribution of outcomes representing the regulator's risk tolerance for example 75% level could be chosen.

## QUESTION 4

i. The approach for determining surrender values should take the following principles into
account:

- For both methods, whether the principle that the surrender value should take policyholder reasonable expectations into account is met depends on whether the calculated surrender values are consistent with the information provided to customers at the sales stage.

- Both methods are likely to meet this principle that the surrender value should not appear too low compared to premiums paid at early durations by definition of the surrender value.

- Traditional products are unlikely to meet the principle that the surrender value should be consistent with projected maturity values at later durations. The guaranteed maturity value is should be higher than premiums paid as it takes investment earnings over the term of the policy into account.

- New-generation products are likely to meet the principle above as the prospective surrender value is likely to progress smoothly towards the maturity value over time.

- Traditional products are unlikely to meet the principle that the surrender value should not exceed the earned asset share in aggregate, over a reasonable period. As, the surrender value is likely to be higher than the asset share at early durations and lower at later durations in the policy term.

- New-generation products are likely to meet the principle above as the prospective method is likely to be lower than the earned asset share.

- The traditional products do not meet the principle that the surrender value should produce a reasonable contribution to profit of the insurer and maintain equity with continuing policyholders and shareholders. There will be losses at early durations and excessive profits at later durations.

- Whether above principle is met for new-generation products depends on whether the basis used for the prospective method allows the insurer to recover the losses at early durations and produce a profit that is not excessive after the second policy anniversary.

- Traditional products are unlikely to meet the principle that the surrender value should avoid selection against the insurer. As early surrenders are encouraged and later surrenders are discouraged.

- For new-generation products surrenders prior to the second policy anniversary may be encouraged, but the effect may be less severe than for the traditional products.

- Surrender values for traditional products are not consistent with those for newgeneration products, thus do not take the approach taken by all competitors into account.

- Consistency of surrender values across new-generation products depends on the basis used for the prospective method.

- New-generation products are unlikely to meet this principle as there is likely to be a discontinuity at the second policy anniversary where the method changes.

- Both methods are likely to meet the objective that the surrender value should not be subject to frequent change, unless the basis for the prospective method is changed frequently.

- Both methods are likely to meet the objective that the surrender value should not be excessively complicated to calculate, unless the basis is complicated for the prospective calculation for the new-generation products.

- Both methods are likely to meet this principle that the surrender value should be capable of being clearly documented.

ii. Profit arising for each of the bases under consideration for the prospective method of
determining surrender values:

- The total profit retained by the insurer is the excess of the earned asset share over the surrender value paid (EAS - SV)

- This can be separated into two parts: the profit earned to date (EAS - SV(p)), and the capitalised value of the profit that will arise in the future due to differences between the original premium rate assumptions and the surrender value assumptions (SV(p) - SV), where SV(p) is the prospective surrender value on the original premium basis.

- At early durations there will be a loss on surrender where the asset share is lower than the premiums paid to date or the prospective surrender value.

- After early durations the profit earned to date is the difference between actual experience and that assumed in the original premium basis.

- The value for capitalised future profits will be: zero if the original premium basis is used for determining the surrender value; and equal to the expected future profits as if the policy had not been surrendered, if the best estimate of future experience is used.

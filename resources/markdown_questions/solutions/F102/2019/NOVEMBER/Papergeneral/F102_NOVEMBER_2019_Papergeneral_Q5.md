## QUESTION 5

i. Description of bonus types:
Regular reversionary bonus:

- A regular reversionary bonus is a bonus that is declared on a regular basis, usually annually, during the lifetime of the contract.

- Once declared it attaches to the benefits and is guaranteed.

- It may be declared as a percentage of basic benefit and/or any bonuses already declared (using a simple, compound or super compound method). Special reversionary bonus:

- A special reversionary bonus is a once-off/irregular increase to the sum assured.

- It could result from surplus from an isolated event for example restructure of a fund or some investment windfall.

- Should declared and communicated in a way that does not change policyholders' reasonable expectations. Terminal bonus:

- A terminal bonus is an addition to the benefit payable, but only determined at the time of the claim or maturity.

- In theory this implies a potentially constantly changing bonus. In practice this does not happen, but even so a company will not guarantee to maintain the bonus at any particular level.

- It is particularly useful for distributing profits that come from volatile sources, such as capital gains on equity shares.

- The bonus may vary by term and duration.

- It is often used to bring the policy value in line with the asset share at date of maturity/claim.

ii. Allowance in pricing:
Regular reversionary bonus:

- The pricing basis may include an explicit margin to price for some minimum bonus every year.

- This will be achieved through a reduction in the interest rate.

- This will be particularly the case if policyholders' reasonable expectations include a regular bonus.

- Any margins for prudence in the basis may implicitly allow for regular bonuses to be declared if emerging experience is better than the prudent assumptions. Special reversionary bonus:

Terminal bonus:

- It is unlikely that this will be priced for explicitly.

- Unless, however, it has become well known that there is a terminal bonus payable on every claim at this life office, which one can argue changes the reasonable expectations of the policyholder. This might be the case for a company that operates with-profits business, with no regular or special bonus declarations.

iii. Impact on choice of bonus type:

- Once a reversionary bonus is declared it becomes part of the guaranteed benefits under a policy, and will therefore be included in the supervisory reserves.

- Terminal bonuses will not increase the supervisory reserves.

- Given the company's high level of free reserves and investment approach, it is likely that it invests in riskier asset classes and does not match assets and liabilities closely.

- The company might prefer to postpone distributing bonuses and lean towards more terminal bonuses, since: investment returns on riskier asset classes may be volatile; if decreases in asset values are not matched by decreases in liabilities, the solvency position might deteriorate.

- The company may also want to add any surplus arising to free assets in order to maintain its solvency position or to use a strong level of free assets to make higher risk investments in the hope of generating higher returns. This will make it lean towards postponing the surplus distribution.

- Alternatively, since the insurer has a healthy solvency margin it may tend towards declaring regular bonuses rather than at the end of the policy term in order to improve the marketability/sales of their product.

- However, the impact of higher supervisory reserves on the solvency margin and new business strain must be considered.

## QUESTION 6

i. Liability characteristics and matching assets:

- The insurer would look to match assets and liabilities as closely as possible. The extent to which the insurer will deviate from this fully matched approach will depend on its risk appetite and free capital.

- The nature of the benefits is without-profit, and this is best matched by fixed interest stocks.

- Fixed interest stock issued by government should be risk free.

- Corporate bonds might be considered if the insurer is willing to accept (and hold capital for) default and illiquidity risk in order to enhance returns.

- If the benefits for any of the products are linked to an index (for example indexlinked immediate annuity) then these liabilities are best matched by index-linked bonds.

- The term of suitable fixed interest stocks depends on the outstanding term of policies and annuities issued by the insurer: Term assurance policies may have terms of less than 10 years. Immediate life annuities and whole of life policies are likely to have terms greater than 10 years.

- Future insurer expenses are likely to be inflation-linked, and these are best matched by index-linked bonds of suitable terms or a mix of real assets that includes a limited exposure to equities.

- Currency is likely to be local, and hence assets need to be of the same currency.

- Shorter-term liabilities (of less than one year) and working capital are best matched by money market stocks: Money market stocks are highly liquid in nature, have stable capital values and are hence a good match for short-term liabilities.

- In practice it might not be possible to find fixed interest stocks of long enough term for the annuities: The insurer will then need to consider whether to accept (and hold capital) for the term mismatch or find alternative investments (for example, foreign bonds of long duration with a currency hedge).

iii. Director's proposal:

- Despite yielding negative returns, there is merit in using bonds to match withoutprofit liabilities: Returns are fixed in monetary terms and the insurer is reducing the risk of insolvency and not meeting benefits by matching appropriately.

- Negative nominal yields do not imply that real yields will be negative as investors might be anticipating a period of deflation.

- The proposal is to significantly mismatch by nature, and the extent to which this can be done depends on: The insurer's solvency level and risk appetite. Regulation.

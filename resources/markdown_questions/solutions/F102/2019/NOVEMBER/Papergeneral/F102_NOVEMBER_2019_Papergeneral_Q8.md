## QUESTION 8

i. Risks to the policyholder:

- Benefits not received due to: Policyholder living much longer than expected and hence, because the monthly income is not guaranteed for life, money could run out. There is no maximum withdrawal rate so funds can be depleted earlier than expected. Insolvency of the insurer.

- Benefits lower than expected due to: Poor performance of the assets underlying the units resulting in lower benefit payments. Policyholders may select investment funds that poorly reflect their risk appetite and/or need for capital protection, resulting in volatile investment returns. The unit fund being eroded by fund management charges, particularly if fund management charges are revised upwards by the insurer. Taxation changes impacting on amounts received. Income received in real terms can be eroded due to high inflation given that the return of the assets may not necessarily be inflation-linked.

ii. Marketability and competitiveness:

- The flexibility provided by the following features of the product is likely to increase the marketability of the product: Withdrawal percentage for monthly income. Switching of portfolios. Transfer of funds to another insurer.

- The following features of the product are likely to negatively impact on the marketability of the product: Variable charges (increases the risk that charges may deplete the fund value). No underlying investment guarantees (increases the investment risk for the policyholder). The product terms and conditions and product risks are relatively complicated and may not be easy for a customer to understand.

- The competitiveness of the product is mainly influenced by the level of charges.

- The insurer may need to consider accepting a lower profit margin or introducing attractive innovative features to this product in this competitive environment. Profitability and financing requirements:

- Charges need to cover expenses (including a contribution to fixed costs) in most foreseeable circumstances and provide a profit margin.

- Profit margins for these policies are likely to be low due to the highly competitive nature of the market.

- There is a mismatch between the charges and the expenses, particularly due to high initial costs and the monthly fund management fee.

- The profitability of this business is therefore sensitive to investment experience, variation in actual expenses amounts and expense inflation and transfers to other insurers.

- This risk is mitigated by variable charges, although it may be difficult to implement increases in the charging structure in practice due to marketability and competitiveness considerations.

- Financing requirements for these policies will depend on the extent of mismatching between charges and expenses.

- The insurer may use the following techniques to reduce the financing requirements for this business: Actuarial funding. Negative non-unit reserves (if permitted by the regulator).

iii. Impact on assumptions for calculating the non-unit reserves for supervisory reporting:
Investment return on the unit fund:

- The estimate of the expected returns on the unit fund over the projected term of the policies would need to be adjusted to reflect the change in expected future economic conditions, taking the following into account: Asset mix for the investment portfolios and spread of policies across investment portfolios. Change in the volatility of future investment returns.

- The inflow amount for charges will depend on the investment return and withdrawal rate from the unit fund. Rates of withdrawal on the fund:

- The expected rates of withdrawal on the fund may be reduced if policyholders are more conservative in poorer economic conditions.

- The expected withdrawal rates may increase if there is an increase in inflation and a higher income is required to meet expenses. Expenses and expense inflation:

- Expense inflation may be higher in poorer economic conditions.

- Allowance for overheads may need to be increased if business volumes for all products sold by the insurer are reduced in poorer economic conditions. Persistency/transfer rates:

- Actions of competitors to maintain business volumes in a poor economic environment (for example reducing charges) may impact on the transfer rates. Discount rate:

- The risk-free rate will change to reflect the economic environment. Margins:

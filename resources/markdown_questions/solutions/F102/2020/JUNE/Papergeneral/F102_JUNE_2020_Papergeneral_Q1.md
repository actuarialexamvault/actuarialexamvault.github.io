## QUESTION 1

i. Matching investments:

- Fixed interest stocks are the most suitable matching assets for the benefits:

- The returns are fixed in monetary terms and this matches the level benefit payments.

- The payments are in local currency and hence fixed interest stocks should be local.

- Expected benefit payments and asset returns should be matched by the term and amount, however this might be difficult in practice:

- Exact cashflow matching can be difficult and costly to achieve (even when death rates are predictable) and hence matching by average duration can be adopted to achieve approximate matching.

- The insurer faces reinvestment risk on coupons received during the deferred period (unless zero-coupon bonds are available to match annuity cashflows).

- The liabilities are likely to be very long term and it is unlikely that stocks of sufficiently long term exist (especially as this is a developing country), creating further reinvestment risk.

- Government-issued stocks are preferable in reducing risk, however high-quality corporate fixed interest stocks may be appropriate for enhancing returns if the insurer is willing to accept default risk.

- If the insurer will not need to realise the assets prior to maturity illiquidity risk will not be a concern.

- As this is a developing country, there may not be a sufficient supply of marketable fixed interest stocks (and of sufficient term) to achieve a matched position, in which case the insurer will need to:

- Consider the next best (low risk) strategy e.g. purchase foreign fixed interest stocks with a currency hedge if available, however, this is unlikely to provide a suitable matching asset.

- Consider investing in a variable-rate instrument while utilising a swap to receive a fixed rate in exchange for floating, however, this is unlikely to be available for long investment terms and counterparty risk may be high.

- Should (or may be required to) hold a mismatch reserve.

- For matching the expenses of the life office, the most suitable assets are those that can provide a real return:

- Index-linked securities (if available) and equities (or a combination of these) may provide returns that are approximately matched to the expense liability.

- Some cash would be held as working capital and for meeting short term obligations.

ii. Costing the option:

- The main elements of the cost comprise mortality, expenses, investment returns and take up rates.

interest rates at the time of exercise and actual mortality of those choosing to exercise the option.

- Simulations could include deterministic mortality assumptions.

- Expenses and interest rates could be stochastic variables.

- Expected cost is based on a sum of the discounted values of probabilityweighted excess annuity rates (of conversion rate less market rate) × annuity income sacrificed. Take up rates:

- This depends on how generous the R10 conversion rate is relative to current annuity rates.

- If overly generous then all annuitants will likely choose to take up the option with the insurer. Mortality:

- The cost to the insurer is based on the value of the difference between the conversion rate and the annuity rate implied by actual mortality rates of those exercising the option.

- There will be a cost to the insurer if the health of annuitants exercising the option is poorer (lower expected longevity) than the average health assumed/implied in the conversion rate.

- The link between take up rates and the mortality assumption for those taking up the option must be estimated since there is an anti-selective effect of those with higher mortality taking up the option.

- The higher the take-up rate, the smaller the anti-selection effect. Expenses:

- Additional expenses of administering the option must be estimated.

- Future expense inflation could be linked to simulated interest rates used in determining the cost of the investment element of the option. Bond yields:

- The insurer will probably have used fixed-interest bonds to match regular annuity payments. There is a cost to the insurer if it is forced to sell these bonds earlier than expected on unfavourable terms.

- The cost to the insurer is based on the difference between the conversion rate and the annuity rate implied by bond yields at the date of exercise.

- The probability and extent to which bond yields rise above those implied by the conversion rate at exercise can be assessed by stochastic modelling of interest rates.

- Alternatively the expected cost can be assessed from market prices of derivatives:

- Put options on bond prices;

- Swaptions (option to swap paying a fixed rate for receipt of a floating rate);

- However, it is very unlikely that sufficiently long-dated derivatives will be available. Part (i) was reasonably well answered, however, it was disappointing to see the number of candidates that did not read the question properly and wrote about free assets, risk tolerance and other factors allowing a deviation from a matched position. Some even suggested using index-linked bonds, equity and property to match the guaranteed level annuity payments, and in some cases, index-linked annuities. Part (ii) was answered less well. Few candidates demonstrated a proper appreciation of the risks faced by the insurer and how to cost for the guarantee. Most answers were far too superficial, and when some detail was provided it usually revealed a lack of understanding. Many provided a generic answer about a stochastic process to produce a distribution of cost, without defining precisely what "cost" represented in this case, and therefore got little credit. Those that mentioned using market prices of options mostly did not specify, or correctly specify, the underlying assets/market variables that the options would be based on.

## QUESTION 2

i. Reasons for monitoring experience:

- Develop earned asset shares

- Update assumptions as to future experience

- Monitor any adverse trends in experience so as to take corrective actions

- Provide management information

ii. Conducting an expense analysis:

- The expense analysis can be conducted by classifying expenses into the following categories:

- Initial expenses, incurred at the inception of a policy;

- Renewal expenses, which relate to the ongoing nature of the policy throughout its term;

- Termination expenses, which arise at the end of a policy; and

- Investment expenses, which relate to the management of Forsure's assets.

- Investment expenses will be allowed for by means of a reduction in the yield on the assets, and thus do not constitute part of the per policy expense.

- Commission is determined by means of a known formula and will be excluded from the expense experience analysis.

- Each expense should be considered in terms of whether it directly relates to a specific product type, such as assurances, or whether it spans across all product ranges.

- In order to allocate expenses across products, they can be considered in terms of whether they relate to:

- The amount of premium written or in force over a period; or

- The amount of benefit written or in force over the period.

- The main items of expense for Forsure will be:

- Salaries and salary-related expenses;

- Property Costs, and

- Costs related to the administration systems and administration of policies.

- Salary costs for the Longevitown office can be allocated entirely to the annuity business.

- Salaries for the groupwide functions should be deducted from the total Mortalitown office salary bill, and the remainder can be allocated entirely to the assurance business.

- The executive salaries can be split according to the total premiums in force for each product type and allocated accordingly.

- For groupwide functions, the salaries can be split according to time spent on each product type, according to time-sheets, and allocated accordingly.

- The entire property cost for the Longevitown office should be allocated to the annuity business.

- For the Mortalitown office, the property expenses should be split according to the floor space used by the assurance business or the group-wide functions.

- The property costs attributable to the assurance business should be allocated to the assurance product.

- For the group-wide functions, property costs can be allocated according to the premium income attributable to each product type, or in accordance with the cumulative time spent working by the staff within the function on each of the products.

- An exception within the group wide function is the marketing function, where costs should be apportioned across products in terms of the number of new policies sold during the period of the analysis.

- The cost of the joint administration should be split according to costs associated with new business and costs associated with in force business.

- If there is no clear delineation between new and in force administration expenses, then the total expenses associated with the administration system can be split according to the benefit amount for new and in force policies, and proportional to the premium income for each product type.

- The cost of each claims administration system can be wholly allocated to the product to which it applies.

- However, an adjustment needs to be made for the costs associated with the implementation of the annuity payments system - which need to be amortised over the expected lifetime of the system.

- The per policy costs for each product are determined as the sum of:

- Initial expenses divided by the amount of new business;

- Renewal expenses divided by the amount of existing business;

- Termination expenses divided by the number of terminations; and

- Appropriate allowance for overheads.

Part (i) was bookwork and was well answered, with most candidates getting full marks.
Part (ii) was reasonably well answered. However, candidates lost marks by only providing general theory and not applying the details of an expense analysis to the specific circumstances of Foresure as set out in the question.

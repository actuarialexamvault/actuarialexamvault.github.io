## QUESTION 3

i. Needs met by a critical illness product:

- Income can be provided from the lump sum via an annuity when the individual cannot work as a result of his critical illness.

- The benefit can be designed to repay a mortgage or other loan when the policyholder's health is in question following diagnosis of a critical illness.

- Medical costs can be funded when the critical illness requires surgery or other expensive treatment.

- A change of lifestyle can be funded where necessary to improve the claimant's health; for example, moving to a less stressful (and lower-paid) job following a heart attack.

- The benefit could be used to improve the quality of life following diagnosis of a critical illness, e.g. paying for a holiday for the insured and his family.

- The benefit can be used against future un-insurability after a critical illness event.

- Other needs suggested include recuperation after illness, taxation planning, medical aids (for example, the installation of specialist equipment in the home to enable the claimant to remain in his/her house).

ii. Why needs may not be met:

- It may not meet all ill-health needs because it is not comprehensive in the diseases covered.

- Because critical illness is a complicated product with complex definitions, the policyholder may not be able to claim as expected. For example, their doctor may say they have had a heart attack, but they may not meet the definition set by the insurer.

- Because the lump sum is predefined, the policyholder may discover that they are over or under insured when the event happens.

- The lump sum paid may be less, or more, than the value of the loan or mortgage.

- The medical costs may already be covered by medical insurance - leading to a windfall gain.

- The lump sum may have no link to the income lost, and in fact there may be no lost income as a result of the critical illness event.

- The policyholder may not easily be able to convert the lump sum into a suitable income.

- There may be exclusions on the policy.

iii. Setting risk rates for the tiered product:

- The actuary has experience data from the existing product. That is always the best place to start with the pricing.

- The actuary will have to derive the incidence rates for the less severe forms of the disease.

- The actuary will also need to consider the progression between severities and the impact this has on the timing of claims.

- It is possible that the company's existing claims data will have information of the timing of when a person goes through each severity of disease.

- It will be necessary to speak to medical experts to get assistance on these new incidence rates.

- The actuary needs to understand how the underwriting process will change, and how this will impact the pricing.

- For example, if it is easy to pick up serious critical illness risks at underwriting stage, but not as easy to pick up risk of less severe events, there is more chance of anti-selection.

- The actuary needs to consider the impact of the new product on claims. There will be more claims, and it will often be less clear-cut when a claim is valid, so the actuary should allow a margin for this uncertainty.

- The actuary should consider seeking reinsurance support. Given the product has been sold in the market for a number of years, there should be reinsurance capacity and expertise.

iv. Reinsurance for the standard product:

- The insurer is large and established.

- It has been selling the existing product for many years.

- Thus:

- There is little need for reinsurance on the existing product.

- There may be a low level quota share, to provide ongoing technical support.

- There may be surplus cover to protect against the largest claims.

- Reinsurance for very large sums assured may be arranged on a facultative basis. Reinsurance for the tiered product:

- The insurer could use a reinsurer's technical assistance

- e.g. with design, pricing, underwriting, reserving and claims management.

- The insurer will also want to reduce claims volatility and protect against parameter risk.

- Thus:

- Significant quota share is likely.

Part (iii) was answered very poorly. Many candidates did not make enough points, and when they did they were generic points, or points that do not apply to risk rates. It is very concerning that candidates at this level do not seem to know the difference between "risk rates" and "office premiums". Most candidates wrote up to hundreds of words on items that have nothing to do with risk rates, e.g. expenses, profitability, target market, competitors' rates, etc., demonstrating very little in the way of higher order thinking.
Part (iv) was poorly answered. Most candidates did not even look at existing structures and how these could change. Many candidates did not even follow the basic instruction to "Discuss how....may differ", and failed to consider the strategy for both products. It was also disturbing to see that many candidates do not even know that increasing retentions means that the insurer will take on more risk, not less. Many candidates failed to even get the basic concept that the new product, with increased uncertainty, would need increased reinsurance compared to the current position for the large established insurer.

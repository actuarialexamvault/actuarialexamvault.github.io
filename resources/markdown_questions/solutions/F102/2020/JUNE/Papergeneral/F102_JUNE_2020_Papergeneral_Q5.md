## QUESTION 5

i. Market consistent valuation of whole life assurance liabilities for the published accounts:

- Project the net liability cashflows for the portfolio.

- Cashflows should include all projected premiums, commissions, expenses and benefit payments (net of reinsurance).

- Take the expected mortality rates and lapse rates into account, based on the policyholder profile on a best estimate basis.

- A risk margin would be included in respect of these assumptions, due to the inherent uncertainty.

- By either including a margin in each assumption or using an overall reserving margin using a "cost of capital approach".

- Period of projection will be to the terminal age (e.g. 100 for the whole life policy).

- The risk-free rate of return associated with each cashflow is taken as the current market redemption yield on a government-backed zero-coupon bond of the same term as the cashflow.

- Where the government bonds are not available at the exact term to maturity of the liability cashflows, a yield curve will need to be constructed using the market yields available for similar bonds traded at those terms to maturity.

- For any liabilities that may grow with inflation (e.g. expenses) a market consistent inflation assumption will need to be determined

- as the difference between the nominal and real bond yields for various points on the yield curve.

- Given that it is a developing economy, the inflation risk premium contained in the real bond yields may be significant and an adjustment may need to be made to the inflation assumption derived as described above.

- Alternatively create a replicating portfolio of assets made up of zero-coupon government bonds that would produce the same cashflows as the liabilities.

- The market value of this replicating portfolio is then the market-consistent valuation of the liabilities.

- Given that it is a developing economy, the market value of the replicating portfolio may have to be adjusted for any short-term anomalies in market values of assets.

- Given that we are dealing with a developing economy that may not have a large and liquid market...

- ...credit may also be taken for any illiquidity premiums in the underlying government bonds, where it is certain that the assets will be held to maturity, if permitted by financial reporting standards.

ii. Impact on profitability:

- A net premium basis:

- Makes implicit allowance for profit.

- Allows profit to emerge in a more stable fashion.

- Profits emerge in line with long term profit margins.

- A realistic gross premium valuation basis:

- Immediately capitalises the difference between the pricing and valuation basis.

- Will be a more dynamic basis, reviewed more frequently and aligned to changes in the mortality and expense experience, as well as the economic conditions.

- As the net premium basis is more prudent, a change to a realistic gross premium method will result in an immediate once-off release of reserves into profit.

- The longer term impact is that the change will likely introduce higher volatility into the emergence of profit.

iii. Potential areas of concern for the shareholders:

- Shareholders are concerned with dividend rates and share price levels.

- Some shareholders may not prefer a high immediate dividend (e.g. for tax reasons).

- Since dividends declared should not jeopardise the solvency position of the insurer the dividends declared are likely to be based on a more prudent basis than the realistic basis.

- Shareholders may be concerned that the change will cause future dividend volatility.

- And in turn the price of the company's listed shares.

- The change in valuation approach may also lead the regulator to stipulate higher solvency requirements for this class of business.

- This, for the same level of profitability, will reduce their return on investment in the company. However given that this is still a small portion of the company's total liability, the regulator and shareholders may be less concerned. This should not have been a difficult question, but many candidates' answers demonstrated a lack of understanding of the underlying theory. In part (i) the better prepared candidates performed well. Most candidates, however, did not provide the level of detail required to score well. Part (ii) was poorly answered. A number of candidates focused on comparing the calculations used for a net and gross premium rather than focusing on the impact the change will have on profitability. A mistake made by a number of candidates was to assume that the same premium would be used for a net premium and gross premium valuation and incorrectly concluded that the change would result in a loss. Part (iii) was generally well answered.

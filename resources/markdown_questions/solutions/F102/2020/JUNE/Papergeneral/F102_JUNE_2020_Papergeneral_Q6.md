## QUESTION 6

i. Assumptions for reinstatement:
Future mortality:

- Realistic mortality assumptions can be derived from the current internal experience.

- Ultimate mortality will be used for the increase in benefit if no additional underwriting is carried out on reinstatement (which is only probable if the increase in Sum Assured is not large).

- There is potential for anti-selection with those in worse health electing to increase the sum assured.

- The extent of the adjustment will be indicated by any historical mortality experience investigations comparing the mortality of policyholders that reinstate to premium paying status, with those that remain paid-up. Discount rate:

- It is likely that the assumption will be the same because the investment strategy is likely to be the same (or similar).

- There, however, may be some additional reinvestment risk post alteration because of the need to invest future premiums.

- If a market-related approach is used, then market related rates at the time of the alteration will be referenced to determine the discount rate.

- Alternatively, the future expected returns on the intended underlying asset mix can be used. Withdrawal rates:

- This assumption can be derived from a recent investigation.

- The basis before alteration is likely to include a relatively low withdrawal rate assumption (assuming a surrender value is available), because no future premium is payable removing a main reason for withdrawing.

- The withdrawal rate, post alteration, could be higher than the pre-alteration assumption because the premium that is now payable could trigger affordability issues.

- Due to a lack of data, it will be difficult to calculate the differences in withdrawal assumptions Renewal expenses, (potential) underwriting costs, claim expenses & alteration expenses:

- The expenses on a realistic basis can be determined from the expense analysis used to determine the expense basis for the current reserve calculation.

- The renewal expenses included in the prospective reserve for altered policies may be increased for the cost of collecting premiums again.

- There could be differences in claims expenses for the altered policies depending on whether the expense is dependent on the size of sum assured or a fixed amount.

- For example, there may be an additional claim assessment cost for relatively large sums assured. Expense inflation:

- The inflation assumption should be consistent with:

- the discount rate assumption; and

- the difference between the returns on index-linked bonds and fixed interest bonds.

ii. Comments:

- The company should check that the alteration is supportable by the asset share at the alteration date in order to avoid making a loss.

- The difference between the asset share and the policy value before reinstatement (calculated on a realistic basis) represents the present value, both historic and future, of the expected profit on the original policy.

- This assumes that the company did not extract profit from the asset share when the policy was made paid-up.

- Using realistic assumptions to determine the policy value after the reinstatement is generous to the policyholders because the company is not including any margins for future deviations from expected experience in the calculation of the premium.

- This may be appropriate, because the company:

- calculated the paid-up value based on realistic assumptions and therefore potentially extracted both past and future profits at the time (based on the original sum assured); and

- the company equates the policy value (after reinstatement) to a policy value (before reinstatement) based on realistic assumptions, which is consistent.

- This approach is inconsistent with the pricing of new policies.

- The policyholder has the option of buying a new policy with a sum assured equal to the difference between the original and paid-up values.

- This alteration is likely to result in a premium that is smaller compared to this boundary condition, because the basis for new policies will include some margins and an allowance for initial expenses.

- The company should consider the risk of anti-selection by policyholders. For example, if no additional underwriting is required, policyholders taking up this option may select against the company.

- To deal with this anti-selection risk, the company could, for example require a declaration of continuing good health

- Depending on how the surrender value is calculated, the premium, using the alteration basis, is likely to be less than the premium the policyholder would pay if he/she surrenders the paid-up policy.

- Using the same basis for the present values before and after the alteration will make the method stable, i.e. a small increase in sum assured, will result in a small increase in premium.

- Using the same methodology for all alterations creates consistency between different types of alterations.

- For example, if the period between making the policy paid up and reinstating (full) cover is short, we can expect the premium for the reinstated cover to be close to the original premium.

- The company will have to consider alteration terms used by competitors, which may affect policyholders' reasonable expectations.

- The alteration basis is based on realistic assumptions, which could potentially change relatively often, and this could lead to inconsistent alteration values over time.

- The alteration basis:

- Could be difficult to explain to policyholders, who are unlikely to be familiar with present value calculations.

- Should be relatively easy to document.

- It is appropriate that the cost of alteration is allowed for in the calculations

- This should be permitted by regulation/professional guidance. Part (i) was a standard question and most candidates obtained high marks on this part. The most common error was to not read the question carefully: some candidates spent considerable time on discussing margins (when the question clearly stated that a realistic basis is used). Some candidates spent too much time on a single assumption and should have been guided by the mark allocation as to the level of detail required. Candidates typically find questions on alterations challenging and this was the case again in part (ii). Very few candidates could use the general conditions to critically evaluate the proposal. Some candidates wasted time by discussing the paid-up sum assured (or even surrender values) when the question clearly asked for comments on the reinstatement.

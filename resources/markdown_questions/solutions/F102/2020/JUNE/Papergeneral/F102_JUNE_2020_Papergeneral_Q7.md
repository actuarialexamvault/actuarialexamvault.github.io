## QUESTION 7

Suitability of the additional benefits: Meeting customers' needs:

- Adding additional benefits increases the flexibility of the product and allows the product to cater for a wider range of customer needs.

- The partial withdrawal benefit gives the policyholder liquidity to pay for unforeseen expenses.

- The change in premium benefit allows the policyholder to reduce the premium and keep the policy in force in the event that affordability becomes an issue.

- Premiums could be increased to facilitate saving for the education of an additional child or for other purposes.

- The waiver of premium benefit allows the policyholder to continue to provide for tertiary education of dependants in the event of the unforeseen circumstances of permanent disability or redundancy.

- However, partial withdrawals, a reduction in premium and higher charges for the waiver of premium benefit will result in lower accumulated funds which may be insufficient to cover the costs of tertiary education resulting in the policy failing to meet the need for which it was originally purchased. Marketability and competitiveness:

- The optional nature of these benefits accommodates both customers who value the additional benefits and are prepared to pay for them as well as customers who are reluctant to pay additional fees and charges.

- Charges for the additional benefits need to be set at an affordable level, so as not to damage the marketability and competitiveness of the product.

- The change in product design increases the complexity of the product.

- In particular, the terms and conditions relating to the redundancy benefit are likely to be complex.

- Customers and sales-persons need to fully understand the additional benefits.

- The marketability of these additional benefits will depend on training of salespersons, on how well the benefits are explained to customers and ease of understanding of disclosures of terms and conditions relating to these benefits.

- The introduction of these benefits also allows the insurer to differentiate itself from the competition. This may:

- Lead to an increase in new business sales.

- Better persistency experience.

- Enable the insurer to have a higher profit margin on this product.

- These advantages may be short lived if competitors follow the insurer in offering these benefits. Profitability:

- The charges for the additional benefits should cover the costs of the benefits and expenses (in most foreseeable circumstances) and cover the targeted profit margin of the insurer.

- The insurer will need to ensure that appropriate assumptions that allow for the risk and possible future changes in experience are used when setting the charges.

- Important assumptions relate to option take-up, disability and redundancy rates, changes in premium, partial withdrawals, investment returns and expenses (including development costs and a contribution to overhead expenses).

- Expenses related to changes to the administration for exercising the option will need to be considered in the alteration fees.

- If the additional benefits are attractive to policyholders this may lead to higher business volumes and consequently higher overall profit.

- The insurer should aim to minimise the sensitivity of profit to changes in experience in the design of the product.

- Profitability will be particularly dependent on:

- Experience relating to the waiver of premium benefit compared to the pricing assumptions.

- Reduction in the unit fund caused by partial surrenders and premium reductions will lead to reduced fund management charges being received.

- Vice-versa for increases in premiums.

- Lower overall surrenders should improve profitability.

Risk characteristics:

- Uncertainty relating to the take up of the waiver of premium benefit and experience relating to disability and redundancy benefits.

- This is exacerbated by the lack of data which the insurer will have available to assist in pricing.

- The insurer is exposed to anti-selection for the waiver of premium benefit which can impact on profitability of the product.

- This would be particularly so if some industries are experiencing high levels of redundancies.

- This risk is exacerbated if it is possible to add the waiver of premium benefit to the policy at any time during the policy term.

- The insurer is exposed to the risk of claims fraud for the waiver of premium benefit.

- The insurer will need to introduce claims verification measures for waiver of premium benefit.

- The insurer will need to consider whether to introduce underwriting for the waiver of premium benefit.

- The level of underwriting and claims verification needs to be selected carefully to avoid dramatically reducing the marketability of the product.

- Higher than expected partial surrenders or premium reductions may mean that the annual management charge may not cover ongoing expenses.

- The insurer may include higher margins in charges to protect itself against uncertain experience.

- Charges may need to be reviewable.

- Increases would be restricted by policyholder expectations and regulation.

- Higher/reviewable charges will damage marketability.

- Reinsurance for the premium waiver benefit may assist in pricing and risk mitigation.

- Increased new business may cause higher than expected new business strain due to higher capital requirements on the premium waiver benefit.

- There could be a lapse and re-entry risk if the additional benefits are not offered to existing policyholders.

- The uncertainty around numbers of partial withdrawals and premium reductions will make charges less predictable.

- There is a reputational risk if the additional benefits are not properly understood and policyholders have insufficient funds at maturity owing to partial surrenders or premium reductions.

- The increased complexity of the benefits may cause an increase in operational risks. Despite being a fairly straightforward question, this question was answered poorly by most candidates. Some of the most disappointing aspects of answers were:

- Many candidates failed to read the question carefully enough, resulting in lost marks. For example:

benefits, which resulted in significant time-wasting and the blurring of points between the current and additional benefits.

- It was clearly stated that the additional benefits were new in the market. A significant number of candidates, however, went on to comment on the impact of competitors offering similar benefit. Failing to carefully read and answer the question asked is bound to result in poor performance.

- The fundamental distinction between premiums and charges was overlooked (or misunderstood) by many candidates.

- Some candidates were not even aware of standard terminology in life insurance, and made references to the "scheme" and "joining" a policy. A few seemed to think that a unit-linked policy was the same as a unit trust.

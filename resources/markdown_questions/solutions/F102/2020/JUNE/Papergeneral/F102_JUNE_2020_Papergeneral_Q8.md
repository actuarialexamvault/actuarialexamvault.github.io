## QUESTION 8

i. Assumptions for pricing for individual districts:
Mortality:

- The mortality assumption should reflect the expected future mortality for the lives insured under the scheme.

- The insurer will only have access to NIS mortality experience data for the scheme covering urban cooperatives for recent years.

- The extent to which the insurer can rely on the mortality experience data of the urban cooperatives depends on the credibility of this data.

- The accuracy and the volume of data will be important in this case.

- The historical mortality experience for the scheme for urban cooperatives will need to be adjusted for any expected changes in the membership profile of the urban cooperatives (e.g. higher number of lives over the age of 60).

- Mortality assumptions will also need to be adjusted for the effects of the inclusion of rural cooperatives into the scheme.

- The assumption will depend on the assumed mix of business between urban and rural cooperatives.

- It should be possible to get a good estimate of this figure, as cover is compulsory.

- Mortality tables for insured lives are not likely to be relevant since this target market has not been insured before.

- The insurer may consider using national mortality rates to set these mortality assumptions.

- Other information on mortality for members of cooperatives (e.g. prevalence of certain diseases in rural areas) may be useful in adjusting mortality rates.

- The assumption for the expense loading for this product should make allowance for the initial costs (e.g. research for the pricing of the product), the on-going costs of administering the scheme and claims costs.

- The insurer should also make allowances for:

- Recovering of the costs of pricing and setting up internal systems for this product.

- Contribution to overhead costs relative to expected business volumes.

- The expense loading assumption will be based on recent experience of these costs for the current scheme covering urban cooperatives, as expenses are likely to be similar for the expanded scheme.

- There may need to be an adjustment to the expenses to allow for additional costs of paying claims in remote rural areas.

- Allowance needs to be made for the increase in expenses from the investigation period to the time when expenses are paid.

- All policies have the same sum insured therefore the expense loading can be expressed as a percentage of the premium quoted. Both:

- The results of the experience analyses used for setting the assumptions will need to take the effects of unusual events into account.

- Include a margin for prudence based on the level of uncertainty in the parameter and financial effect of risk.

ii. Mortality risk:

- The main risk for this product is that actual mortality rates are higher than those assumed in the pricing.

- Inaccurate and limited data, especially relating to rural cooperatives, increases the risk.

- There will be significant cross-subsidies in the pricing (e.g. by age and gender). The profile of members of cooperatives may change over the year of cover invalidating assumptions.

- The insurer is exposed to the risk of aggregation of claims (e.g. from workplace accident or natural disaster) since groups of lives insured are working in the same industry and location.

- Anti-selection risk is mitigated through the government requirement that cover is compulsory for all members of the cooperative

- and the fact that all benefits are the same.

- Mortality experience may be higher than expected due to claims fraud. Expense risk:

- The insurer has no previous experience on expenses for rural policyholders on which to base costs, exacerbating the risk.

- The insurer may also incur significant costs in upgrading administration systems to accommodate the rural cooperative business and larger business volumes. Such costs will be difficult to estimate up front, and hence pose a risk.

- The accuracy of the per policy expense assumptions is dependent on estimated business volumes for this product.

- If the insurer is awarded a smaller number of districts than expected then:

- Development and systems costs may not be recovered.

- There will be a smaller portfolio over which to spread overhead costs.

- However, it can be argued that the insurer can reduce costs if business volumes are lower than expected.

- For example, close branches and reduce staff and office space.

- But there is likely to be time and cost involved in implementing cost reduction strategies.

- Also the insurer needs to employ experienced staff not easy to retrench staff when business volumes are lower and re-employ when business volumes increase.

iii. Management of mortality risk:

- Reinsuring some of the business.

- The reinsurer may also assist in pricing the product.

- This passes profits onto the reinsurer and exposes the insurer to the risk of default of the reinsurer.

- Set up effective claims verification processes to manage claims fraud.

- Regular monitoring of mortality experience to allow the insurer to use more accurate mortality assumptions in its pricing over time. Management of expense risk:

- The insurer needs to maintain strict control over expenses.

- Particularly for servicing the business of rural cooperatives in remote areas.

- The insurer needs to monitor costs regularly and take action where necessary to reduce costs (for example automate the claim verification processes).

- Consider outsourcing the claims process, if this option is more cost effective

- and claims fraud can still be adequately managed. Both:

- Since the government awards business to insurers based on the premium quoted, the insurer needs to ensure that its premiums are competitive to get the business volumes it has targeted.

inflation which should not have a significant effect on the assumptions for this product as the pricing is for a one year contract. Many candidates did not generate enough points and often repeated points in different ways.
Part (ii) was generally poorly answered. Most candidates got the marks for mortality and expenses being higher than anticipated, however, most other points were missed.
Part (iii) was answered reasonably well. However, monitoring experience was, surprisingly, not mentioned very often.
In general candidates did not generate enough points for the question as a whole. This may have been related to poor time management.

## QUESTION 3

i. Considerations for the methodology for determining alterations.

- Affordability.

- Fairness between shareholders and policyholders and reasonable amount of profit.

- Manages anti-selection-risk.

- Policyholder Reasonable Expectations (PRE).

- Consistency with boundary conditions.

- Stability (including over time and duration).

- Alteration terms used by competitors.

- Ease of administration and calculation and documentation.

- Ease of explanation to policyholders.

- The method should be allowed by regulation and professional guidance.

ii. Suitability of the method for an alteration of an increase in the sum insured for a term assurance
policy.
Affordability:

- The company should check that the alteration is supportable by the asset share to avoid making a loss.

- The earned asset share together with future premiums, should therefore meet the cost of the benefits and expenses after alteration Fairness between shareholders and policyholders and reasonable amount of profit:

- The difference between the asset share and the policy value before alteration (calculated on the original premium basis) represents the accumulated value of historic margins.

- This could be a reasonable amount of profit to extract.

- Use of the original premium basis to determine the policy value after the alteration means that:

- The company should extract profit over the remaining term consistent with what was expected in the original pricing basis.

- This may be reasonable but may be inconsistent with the profit (more or less than) the company makes from new business policies.

- The calculation of the present value of the policy after the alteration should not include an allowance for initial expenses.

- However, an allowance will be required if additional commission is payable due to the increase in the sum assured.

- Similarly, the alteration expenses should be deducted from the policy value before the alteration (or added to the policy value after the alteration). Anti-selection-risk:

- It is likely that policyholders in poor health, in particular, would like to increase the sum assured.

- To deal with this anti-selection risk, the company could:

- require a declaration of continuing good health;

- restrict the conditions on which this alteration can be performed, for example, link it to a life event such as the birth of a child; or

Policyholder Reasonable Expectations (PRE):

- The terms offered are not consistent with new business terms.

- It may be cheaper to buy a new policy for the increase in the sum assured, which may be inconsistent with policyholder reasonable expectations.

- The company will have to consider alteration terms used by competitors. Consistency with boundary conditions:

- It may be cheaper to buy a new policy for the full sum assured, which creates a lapse-and-reentry risk.

- However, this risk is mitigated to some extent, because the policyholder is now older and will have to go for full underwriting again. Stability (including over time and duration):

- Using the same basis for the present values before and after the alteration will make the method stable.

- Therefore, a small increase in the sum assured should result in only a small increase in premium.

- For a particular policy, the alteration basis also does not change over the duration of the policy creating consistency over time. Ease of administration and calculation and documentation:

- The company will have to keep a record of the original premium basis, which could be administratively cumbersome and difficult to document over time. Ease of explanation:

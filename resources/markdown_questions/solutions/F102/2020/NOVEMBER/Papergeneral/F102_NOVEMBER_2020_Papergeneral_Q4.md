## QUESTION 4

i. Factors for determining the bonus philosophy.

- Once reversionary bonus has been allocated to a policy it becomes guaranteed and must be paid on death or maturity.

- Whereas terminal bonus gives the company more flexibility because the amount of terminal bonus is determined when the insured event occurs.

- The assets underlying the investment fund for these policies are high-risk equities which are likely to have volatile returns.

- Therefore, the assets share of these policies is likely to be volatile.

- Since terminal bonuses are not guaranteed they are most suited to the distribution of the volatile returns from equity investments.

- It is therefore expected that the insurer will follow the approach of high terminal bonuses and low reversionary bonuses.

- Since terminal bonuses can be reduced in theory if there is a fall in the asset share of the policies.

- High terminal bonuses result in more deferment of distribution of surplus.

- Use of super compound reversionary bonus will assist with deferral of surplus.

- This will also assist the insurer in maintaining its level of free assets, which is important since the level of free assets is low.

- Low reversionary bonuses reduces the risk that guaranteed benefits might exceed the asset share of the policies at maturity due to a fall in equity markets.

- The excess of the guaranteed benefits over the asset share would need to be paid out of free assets thereby reducing the free assets of the insurer.

- Reversionary bonuses form part of the supervisory reserves, but reserves would not be held for terminal bonus.

- A lower proportion of reversionary bonuses would reduce the statutory reserves that the insurer needs to hold for this product which is important to the insurer given its low level of free assets.

- The strategic split between reversionary and terminal bonuses will also depend on policyholder reasonable expectations.

- This will be influenced by the practice of bonus declarations for other products for this insurer and the practice of competitors.

- This product may not be marketable if competitors offer high reversionary bonuses.

- Policyholders prefer the certainty of higher reversionary bonuses.

- The higher level of investment freedom and the expected higher return from high-risk equity investments may generate higher returns to policyholders.

- This may be attractive to policyholders who are prepared to accept a lower level of certainty for potential higher returns.

- The product may generate sales if marketed to this target market.

ii. Possible impact on terminal bonus rates.
There may be no impact on the bonus rates of the insurer:

- If the fall in global equity markets has not impacted the high-risk equity investments underlying the with-profits fund for these policies.

- If the equity markets are expected to recover in a short time.

- If the current benefits payments including terminal bonuses is lower than the asset share of the policies after the fall in equity markets.

- Recent terminal bonus declarations may have resulted in benefit amounts that are lower than the asset share due to smoothing or if the fall in equity markets was already anticipated. The insurer may reduce terminal bonuses for the current year if:

- Benefit payments are higher than the asset share after the fall in equity markets.

- This may be possible if policy documentation and regulations permit the insurer to reduce terminal bonus rates that have already been declared for policies that are maturing.

- It is important for the insurer to reduce terminal bonus rates on surrender of policies to avoid selection against the fund. The insurer may reduce future terminal bonus rates:

- To smooth out higher terminal bonus payments in the current year and losses due to benefit payments above the asset share of policies.

- If global economic conditions are slow to improve and low equity returns persist in the future. Any reduction in terminal bonus rates will depend on:

- Policyholder expectations and documentation to policyholders.

- The smoothing policy of the insurer and how this influences the potential size of the change in bonus rates and the time period over which rates would be changed.

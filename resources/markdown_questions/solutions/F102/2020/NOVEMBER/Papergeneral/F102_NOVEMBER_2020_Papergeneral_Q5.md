## QUESTION 5

i. The value of the liabilities for the whole life policies on market-consistent basis would be
determined as follows:

- A market-consistent value of a liability should be determined as the price that someone would charge for taking responsibility for the liability, in a market in which such liabilities are freely traded. Where this information is not available approximate measures are used. Cashflow projection approach.

- Project the expected liability cashflows in each future year, under the portfolio of whole life assurance policies.

- These cashflows would include guaranteed benefit payments, regular commission payments, ongoing expenses and premiums.

- Market consistent assumptions might be found as follows:

- Mortality assumptions could be determined from reinsurance risk premium rates;

- Expense assumptions could be determined from expense agreements available in the market e.g. third party administration companies; and

- Inflation assumption could be determined from the difference between risk-free fixed interest and inflation-linked bonds of similar term.

- As it may not be practical to find market-consistent expense and demographic assumptions, the cashflow projections would therefore be made on a best estimate basis plus margins to allow for the uncertainty of the payments.

- This may be done by applying the margin to each such assumption or by using the "cost of capital" approach.

- The projected cash flows would then be discounted at current risk-free rates of interest.

- The risk-free rate of interest to discount a cashflow due in t years' time would be the current market redemption yield on a secure zero-coupon government bond of the same term.

- Swap rates may be used if the swap market is sufficiently deep.

- Alternatively, high quality corporate bond could be used, with an adjustment to the yield, to allow for any credit risk.

- Inflation-linked bond returns could be used for inflation-linked liabilities such as expenses. Replicating portfolio

- A replicating portfolio of assets could be selected as a portfolio of zero-coupon bonds with exactly the same future cashflows as the projected liability flows under the model.

- The uncertainty in the timing of the cashflows remains and therefore the required term of the zero-coupon bonds.

- The current market value of this portfolio could then be considered as the market-consistent valuation of the book of whole life assurance policies.

ii. The investment guarantee in the 10-year single premium unit-linked product is analogous to
options traded in the market place:

- Guaranteed minimum maturity values correspond to European put options.

- Guaranteed minimum death values could be viewed as corresponding to American put options.

- However European options can also be used if the timing of the expected guaranteed future death benefits can be estimated.

- The underlying asset for the options is the local All-Share total return index.

- The exercise price corresponds to the death and maturity guarantee.

- For the in-force endowments, the expected minimum guaranteed benefits on a per-policy basis using the guaranteed minimum return needs to be projected.

- From this the insurer will obtain a schedule of expected guaranteed minimum death and maturity benefits.

- The insurer will also need to determine the level of the All-Share index corresponding to the minimum guaranteed benefits, as this will be used to determine the required exercise price on the options.

- The market price of the options of relevant term and exercise price will be used to determine the liability for the investment guarantees. This method is unlikely to be suitable since:

- The method requires market prices for a very large number of put options (there will be many combinations of terms and exercise prices required).

- Even in developed markets it may be difficult to find all the market prices needed, it will be even more impractical in a developing country.

- Market prices may be distorted by short-term factors.

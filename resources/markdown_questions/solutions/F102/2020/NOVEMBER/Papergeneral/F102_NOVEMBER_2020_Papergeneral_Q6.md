## QUESTION 6

i. Considerations:

- The benefits would need to be attractive to the employer (as potential sponsor) and to the employees.

- The definition of disability would need to be appropriate. For example, based on own/other job or Activities of Daily Living.

- The benefit should take account of pre-disability income (e.g. income in the month prior or average monthly income over the year prior to disability claim).

- The replacement ratio needs to be such that it does not discourage a return to work. For example, 60%-90% of pre-disability income may be appropriate.

- An appropriate escalation rate could be considered, e.g. inflation-linked.

- The duration of the benefit would need to be considered. The benefits would need to cease on recovery, death or at an appropriate age, most likely the normal retirement age.

- The timing of benefit payments, likely to be weekly or monthly depending on the frequency of wage payments.

- The appropriateness of deferred periods.

- Whether a proportionate benefit would be offered on a partial return to work.

- Whether there are any regulatory requirements or restrictions.

ii. Risks faced:

- The insurer will not have the necessary data or experience to price accurately.

- The new product has a different target market making this more challenging. Claim rates will be significantly different for a low-income group relative to the professionals currently insured.

- The new product will have lower sums insured, and hence the expense loadings may have to be a bigger proportion of the premiums.

- The administration of the new product, in terms of monitoring the lives at risk, will be more complex as the insurer will need to check each week or month who is on risk for that week or month.

- This makes the estimation of expenses more difficult.

- The volumes of business written will be difficult to estimate, which is important for expense loading assumptions.

- There is more chance that the new product could be abused by the employer who:

- puts underperforming workers on disability or manipulates the wages or salaries of employees.

- The small sums insured may not justify expensive claims management, leading to more fraudulent, or marginal, claims being admitted.

- The small sums insured may not justify a lot of underwriting being done, which will impact the experience.

iii. Role of a reinsurer:

- A reinsurer can assist with the product development:

- Pricing and how proposed premiums compare to the rest of the market;

- Determination of product features and terms and conditions; and

- Risk management of the product (claims, underwriting, administration).

- A reinsurer can share in the risk of the product.

- This would probably be through a quota share arrangement.

- As this is a new product, for a medium-sized insurer, a reinsurer could assist with financing for the product. For example, through financial reinsurance.

- If there are significantly more claims a reinsurer could assist with claims management.

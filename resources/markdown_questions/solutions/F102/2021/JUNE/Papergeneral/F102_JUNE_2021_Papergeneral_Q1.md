## QUESTION 1

i. Explanation:

- The earned asset share (EAS) per policy is, broadly speaking, the accumulated value of premiums less the policy's share of actual benefits and expenses paid , and therefore is an estimate of the assets available per policy.

- Profit on surrender is equal to the EAS per policy less the surrender benefit paid.

- The profit on surrender is thus zero when the surrender benefit paid is equal to the EAS.

- The minimum surrender benefit is zero, which means that there is always a loss on a surrender when the EAS is negative (early on in the policy term).

- The original pricing basis will include margins and profit loadings (i.e. the pricing basis is prudent).

- The profit on surrender can be specified as (EAS - SV') + (SV' - SV``), where:

- EAS is the earned asset share;

- SV` is the prospective reserve on the original pricing basis; and

- SV`` is the prospective reserve on the surrender value basis.

- The difference between the EAS and the prospective reserve on the original premium basis, EAS - SV`, represents the accumulated value of the historic margins and profit loadings to date.

- If the surrender value paid is similar to the prospective reserve on the premium basis, the insurance company retains the difference between the assumed experience (incl. margins) in the premium basis and the actual experience, which should generally lead to a profit.

- If the actual experience is worse than expected (incl. margins), a loss will be incurred on surrender.

- The difference between the prospective reserve on the original pricing basis and the prospective reserve using the realistic basis represents the present value of future margins and profits included in the pricing basis.

- If the surrender value basis is assumed to be equal to the realistic basis, the difference between the EAS and the realistic reserve represents the current value (at date of withdrawal) of both historic profits and future margins.

- Through a suitable choice of the surrender value basis, the company can manage the amount of profit extracted on a surrender, in line with its corporate aims.

ii. The proposal should be measured against the following principles:

- Affordability:

- In general, the penalty is required to recover at least:

- the cost of initial expenses (not yet recovered at the date of alteration); and

- the cost of carrying out the alteration.

- A proportion of the original 1% asset management fee would have been required to recover initial expenses over the whole policy term, which the company will no longer receive.

- It is therefore reasonable that the penalty:

- considers the reduction in outstanding policy term in deriving the alteration penalty; and

- is not based on the full 1% asset management charge.

- However, the penalty will not fully compensate the company for the "lost charges", because:

- the fund value would have increased due to future premiums, for example: and

- the fund value after the alteration is now smaller, due to the penalty, negatively affecting future management charges.

- Therefore, whether the company will be able to recover the outstanding initial expenses (and receive a contribution to profit) is dependent on whether 0.5% is large enough.

- At early durations the company is very unlikely to have recovered initial expenses because the fund value is likely to be quite small.

- Fairness:

- Because the penalty is dependent on the fund value, in monetary terms, a small reduction in term at later policy durations may lead to a relatively large penalty compared to a small reduction in term at earlier durations (depending on the growth of the fund value).

- The company therefore needs to consider the fairness of the likely crosssubsidy between alterations at early durations and late durations.

- Policyholder Reasonable Expectations (PRE):

- A small reduction in the term of the policy may result in a relatively small penalty, in percentage terms, (and vice versa), which may look reasonable to policyholders.

- Reductions in term for policies close to maturity result in a relatively small penalty, which should be consistent with PRE that the available fund value close to maturity should be similar to the maturity value expected at the end of the original term.

- Boundary Conditions:

- The limiting case of a reduction in outstanding term, is a surrender.

- The company will therefore have to consider whether this penalty is consistent with a surrender penalty, when there is a significant reduction in outstanding term.

- The company will also have to consider whether the surrender value before the alteration is consistent with the surrender value after the alteration.

- Changes over calendar time and duration:

- The percentage penalty will be consistent over time, for a given reduction in policy term.

- However, as it is applied to the fund value, the penalty may be relatively volatile in monetary terms over the policy duration.

- The penalty is easy to:

- explain to policyholders.

- In addition, the penalty should:

- be compared to competitor products in the market; and

- comply with any regulatory requirements and/or professional guidance. Candidates that were well-prepared did well in part (i), which was bookwork. In part (ii), a common error was that candidates interpreted the penalty in percentage terms only, and did not consider the consequences of the penalty being a function of the fund value. A large number of candidates incorrectly referred to the earned assets share (a concept applicable to with-profit and conventional without profit products), when the question was about a unit-linked contract. Some candidates also confused the "reduction" in outstanding term with the "remaining" outstanding term, e.g. the policyholder may request a reduction in term of 1.5 years, while the remaining outstanding term may be 10 years.

## QUESTION 2

i. Factors influencing the claims experience for the critical illness accelerator benefit:

- Diagnosis rates for the conditions covered under the critical illness benefit, this is influenced by:

- Medical advances may allow for more reliable diagnosis of certain illnesses or more routine operations.

- Changes in lifestyle of policyholders that may influence the risk of having a medical condition.

- For example, an increase in policyholders who stop smoking may reduce lung cancer diagnosis rates.

- Availability of preventative medicine programmes, facilitating earlier detection and recovery from conditions before they reach the level of severity required for a claim.

- Whether the wording of claims definitions is strict and clear, loose wording of claims definitions may result in the insurer being forced to pay for medical conditions that were not priced in the product.

- Level of underwriting at the inception of the policy.

- Effectiveness of claims management procedures at the claims stage.

- State of the economy, as a worsening economy may lead to an increase in fraudulent claims.

ii. Reasons for a minimum and maximum sum assured:

- There are certain fixed costs required to sell an insurance policy and get it on the books.

Reasons for a maximum sum assured:

- The insurance company may be concerned about anti-selection, and limiting the sum insured may result in policyholders who are looking to anti-select going to another insurance company.

- The insurer may be concerned about one large claim impacting its profitability, or the stability of its profitability.

- The insurer may be concerned about one large claim impacting its solvency and large sum assured levels increasing its capital requirements.

iii. Reasons for underwriting:

- It protects the insurer against anti-selection.

- It helps the insurer to identify the lives with substandard health risks.

- It assists the insurer in setting the special terms to offer to the substandard risks.

- Underwriting helps ensure that all risks are rated equitably.

- Underwriting helps ensure that mortality experience is consistent with the pricing basis.

- Underwriting reduces the risk from over-insurance (through financial underwriting).

iv. Types of underwriting:
Medical:

- The purpose of medical underwriting is to assess the health of the individual applying for the policy.

- Medical underwriting would be done:

- Using the application form, which would have many medical related questions, including specific questions on health, family history, smoking status, height, weight etc.

- Getting a report from a doctor.

- Using specific test results (blood tests, lung function etc.). Financial:

- The purpose of financial underwriting is to ensure that the sum assured reflects the financial circumstances of the individual taking out the policy.

- If there is over-insurance the consequences are that:

- There is a greater chance of the policyholder lapsing the policy as they cannot afford it, this may be exacerbated by selective-lapses.

- There could be fraudulent activity, e.g. policyholders exaggerating the severity of a critical illness (with the assistance of their doctor) if there are significant financial benefits.

- The underwriting would be done by:

- Looking at financial statements, over several years, for individuals who own their own businesses. Avocational/Occupational:

- The purpose of this underwriting is to ensure that the individual:

- Does not participate in a dangerous hobby (for example skydiving); or

- Does not have a particularly hazardous occupation (for example bomb disposal expert).

- The underwriting would be done by using a questionnaire in which the applicant would have to state their occupation and/or hazardous pursuits.

- It may also be of relevance to capture information on whether the applicant plans to visit regions which could be considered as dangerous.

v. Variation by size:

- Medical underwriting will vary by size of policy as follows:

- The larger the policy the more underwriting would be done.

- For smaller sums insured you may rely on the medical questions in the application form only.

- For smaller sums insured the concerns of anti-selection are significantly less, and a declaration of income/wealth may be sufficient from the applicant.

"small and big insurers", rather than "sums insured". Many candidates failed to say what underwriting would be done, e.g. questionnaire, doctor's report, financial underwriting, etc.

## QUESTION 3

i. Main differences:

- For the unitised accumulating with-profit contract, one way to handle the unit part is for the unit price to remain constant and the company allocates additional units to each contract, usually annually at the bonus declaration; for unit-linked contracts the unit price will be changed, usually on a daily basis.

- For the unitised accumulating with-profit contract where the unit price changes, the change in unit price usually comprises a guaranteed part and a "bonus" part (which is at the company's discretion); for unit-linked contracts, the change in unit price solely reflects the change in the net asset value per unit.

- For the unitised accumulating with-profit contract there may be a terminal bonus payable on certain pre-defined events; for unit-linked contracts terminal bonus will not apply.

- For unit-linked contracts there is no discretion on the surrender value benefit payable, which is the bid value of units less a specified penalty; for the unitised accumulating with-profit contract the company may have discretion over the right to apply a market-value reduction, and the size of the adjustment to be applied.

- For the unitised accumulating with-profit contract some charges could be taken implicitly through the bonus rate, with no explicit charging structure; a unit-linked contract will most likely have explicit charges.

ii. Factors to take into account:
Principles of investment:

- In order to minimise risk, a company should select investments that are appropriate to the nature, term and currency of the liabilities.

- The investments should also be selected so as to maximise the overall return on the assets, where overall return includes both investment income and capital gains.

- The extent to which the appropriate investments referred to above may be departed from in order to maximise the overall return will depend, inter alia, on the extent of the company's free assets. Policyholder return/bonus expectations:

- These will be formed from past bonuses and from marketing material.

- Higher (and real) return expectations will require greater investment in real-type assets such as equity and property to match the liabilities by nature.

Free assets held by the insurer:

- For death and maturity benefits there exists the risk of assets being insufficient to meet the guarantees (unless these were matched), in which case free reserves will be needed.

- The size of free assets influences the extent of mismatching that is possible: The smaller the free reserves, the less the risk that can be taken and thus the greater the matching of assets and liabilities:

- Declared regular bonuses are guaranteed (as negative bonuses are not possible) and fixed in nature, and these should be matched by fixed-interest stocks.

- Terminal bonuses may be real in nature and these may be matched by real-type assets (however lower volatility real assets are likely to be favoured if free reserves are low).

- The company's administrative expenses are real in nature, requiring real-type assets to match these.

- Lower free assets may be met by greater postponement of profits (i.e. lower regular bonuses relative to terminal bonuses) to lower the value of guarantees relative to asset values. Expected split between regular and terminal bonuses:

- The more the profits can be postponed and declared as terminal bonus, the greater the investment freedom to invest in higher-return assets in order to maximise terminal bonuses. Asset characteristics:

- As this is a developing country, suitable asset choice might be difficult e.g. there may not be sufficient low-risk fixed interest bonds to match fixed guarantees - the insurer then needs to find the closest acceptable assets however this increases the mismatch risk.

- Illiquid and unmarketable assets (such as direct property and other assets given the developing nature of the country) are unlikely to be suitable - even if surrender values are not guaranteed, it may be difficult to meet these if too many illiquid assets are held and surrender experience is heavier than expected. Assets held by competitors for similar products:

- The insurer may not wish to deviate too far from competitor asset allocations in order to reduce the risk of declaring uncompetitive bonuses.

- However competitor portfolios may not be disclosed.

- Competitor asset allocations may be irrelevant if circumstances differ (e.g. different product features etc.). Other factors:

- Regulatory restrictions will need to be adhered to e.g. asset limits, limits for admissible assets in solvency demonstration, prescribed assets.

iii. Methods for determining investment guarantee charges:
Option-pricing techniques:

- The options incorporated into the life contracts are analogous to options traded in the market place with guaranteed minimum values corresponding to suitable put options.

- However this method is unlikely to be useful in this case:

- The method requires market prices for a very large number of put options (there will be many combinations of terms and exercise prices required) which will not be possible in a developing country.

- It is unlikely that put options even exist for the insurer's assets backing this product, and it is unlikely that a suitable combination of puts will be found. Stochastic simulation technique:

- The assets and liabilities for a new contract are projected over the 10-year period:

- The assets should reflect the most likely assets held by the insurer.

- The liabilities will comprise the fund values at various durations over the policy contract, including at maturity.

- Projections will need to be done for a model point representing the "average" expected profile of future new business.

- Asset projections:

- Asset return projections will be done by an Economic Scenario Generator (ESG) which will require various assumptions including moments of asset class return and inflation distributions as well as co-variances between variables.

- A suitable number of scenarios (possibly 50 000 or more) will be required from the ESG to produce scenarios of future asset values at various durations over the policy contract.

- Fund value projections:

- The company's policy / formula for calculating regular bonuses will need to be incorporated in the model in order to project future fund values.

- Expected mortality rates are required to estimate future death claims.

- Cost of investment guarantee:

- The cost of the guarantee is based on the excess of the fund value at claim stage (death or maturity) over the value of assets at that time (nil if assets exceed the fund value).

- The overall cost of the guarantee can be assessed from its components:

- Probability of "biting" (A) x Average cost given that the guarantee "bites"

(B).

- "B" = the average shortfall of assets relative to fund value given that a shortfall occurs.

- The above must also reflect the probability of a claim (e.g. death or survival to maturity).

- The above cost ÷ model point single premium produces a premium-related cost.

- Investment guarantee charge:

- The company may wish to adjust the above-calculated cost:

- It may require the charge to be greater than the expected cost to provide additional security.

- It may wish to reflect a discounted value of the cost as at policy inception.

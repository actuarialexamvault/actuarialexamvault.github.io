## QUESTION 4

i. How a passive valuation approach differs from an active approach:

- A passive approach uses a valuation methodology which is relatively insensitive to changes in market conditions and a valuation basis which is updated relatively infrequently, while an active approach would be based more closely on market conditions with the assumptions being updated on a frequent basis.

- Under passive approaches assumptions may be "locked in" i.e. they remain unchanged from those used when the policy was first written and the liability for it first determined.

- Under a passive valuation approach capital requirements may be determined using a simplified approach (such as holding a prescribed percentage of base liabilities), while under an active approach a risk-based calculation is more likely to be used.

ii. Points in response to director's comments:
"The net premium valuation method makes no allowance for future bonuses and is imprudent because it does not include future renewal expenses."

- For regular premium business while the net premium method (NPM) does not include explicit assumptions for future expenses, implicit allowance is made.

- The NPM takes credit for future net premiums (which allow for mortality and interest only, not expenses), while the higher office premium will be received

- this difference should normally be sufficient to cover renewal expenses;

- However this is not guaranteed to always be true and this should be tested;

- For single premium business as there are no future premiums received, there is no implicit expense allowance, so unless an explicit expense reserve is held, the unadjusted NPM reserve would not be sufficient.

- Implicit allowance for future bonuses could be allowed by using a lower valuation interest rate in the NPM.

- For regular premium business, a further implicit allowance for future bonuses could be included in the difference between the office and net premiums.

- The NPM should normally lead to a prudent reserve, however this is not guaranteed and should be tested, in particular for statutory reporting purposes. "The company's passive valuation approach uses outdated assumptions and values that distort the company's financial position."

- As assumptions are rarely changed under a passive approach, there is a risk that they become outdated.

- Infrequent changes can lead to reserves becoming less prudent e.g. if deteriorating mortality experience is not taken into account.

- However the NPM is relatively insensitive to assumption changes, so reserves could still remain sufficient.

- Even under a passive approach assumptions should be reviewed to check that they do not lead to insufficient reserves.

- Under a passive approach asset values (e.g. book value) are likely to be out of date.

- If market values are substantially higher the company could be underestimating its solvency position.

- However this is only likely to be an issue if assets and liability values are inconsistent (e.g. asset values could be written up if appropriate to match cost of bonuses declared).

- Under a passive approach the solvency position may be relatively static and may thus not show a realistic financial position.

iii. Advantages:

- A more realistic financial position is reflected (more useful for shareholders).

- Important trends are more easily and quickly identified, allowing management to take corrective action sooner.

- As the calculation of capital requirements is likely to be risk-based it should be more realistic and informative than a simple percentage method - this should lead to more informed management decisions (e.g. in allocating capital to business lines). Disadvantages:

- An active approach will be more complex and costly to perform.

- It may be more complex for management to understand and explain.

- It requires more subjectivity (more assumptions are needed).

- It should lead to greater volatility of financial results.

- In particular there may be a big one-off change at the time of switching between methods. Part (i) was not answered as well as it should have been. The question asked for differences in the approach, and yet most candidates listed any differences that they could think of, including features, advantages and disadvantages. Some candidates simply dumped everything they knew about both methods. Part (ii) was not answered well as many candidates did not address the specific issues raised by the director. Many candidates gave details on the gross premium valuation method, which was not relevant. Many candidates indicated that implicit allowance is made for expenses and future bonuses, but they were not able to explain how. Part (iii) was generally well answered.

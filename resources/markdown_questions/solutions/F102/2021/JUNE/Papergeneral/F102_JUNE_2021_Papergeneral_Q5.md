## QUESTION 5

i. Pricing of units for the internal unit-linked fund should follow the equity principle.

- This means that the interests of unit holders that are not involved in the transaction should not be affected by the transaction.

- The guidance note covers the appropriation price i.e. the price at which an insurer will create a unit since it is for expanding unit funds. The approach to calculating the appropriation price is as follows:

- Determine the market 'offer price' value of the assets held by the fund.

- Add the expenses (including stamp duty on purchase) that would be incurred in the purchase of these assets.

- Subtract the value of any current liabilities (e.g. investments purchased but not yet settled).

- Add any accrued income (i.e. interest income from fixed-interest securities and deposits, net of any outgo, such as fund charges).

- Subtract any allowance for accrued tax (if applicable).

- Divide by the number of units existing at the valuation date (before any new units are created).

- The appropriation price is then adjusted for any bid-offer spread that the product design may include.

ii. Disclosure requirements at inception of policy:

- Premium amount including frequency and rate of escalation.

- Charges, including allocation rate, asset management fees, charges for guarantees etc.

- Whether the charges are reviewable and any conditions around the reviewability of charges.

- Description of the method of the calculation of unit prices

- Length of the term of the contract

- Investment funds available. Including:

- Description of the level of risk related to investment funds, underlying asset mix, etc.

- Disclosures of projected maturity benefits with conditions on how these values are calculated and disclosed, including:

- Investment/maturity guarantees.

- Minimum benefits for risk events (e.g. death or disability), including:

- Definition of risk events, underwriting requirements, waiting periods, etc.

- Projected surrender values, including a description of the method of their calculation.

- Allowable alterations to the product including changes in premiums, partial withdrawals, changes in the term of the contract, etc.

- Initial and renewal commission payable.

- Contact details of the company.

## QUESTION 6

i. Mortality

- Products provided to borrowers of People's MFI are compulsory and the new product is voluntary.

- Also, the new product has no underwriting and a short term, which makes it easier for customers to take out the term assurance as there is little commitment on their side.

- This may result in large anti-selection and thus higher mortality than the credit life policies.

- While micro-finance loans generally are for the same low-income market as targeted for the term assurance, there will be some implicit underwriting in the credit life pool owing to the credit checks performed for the loan (e.g. having an income). There may also be higher income brackets in the credit life pool.

- These factors suggest the term assurance mortality should be worse than the credit life book. Acquisition expenses

- Commission to People's MFI may be low since the MFI is part of the same financial group.

- Marketing costs of maintaining the established relationship with People's MFI may be low compared to the volume of business.

- Acquisition expenses for the term assurance depend on the cost of salaries and incentives for agents working in the call centre. This may be higher or lower per unit than the commission to People's MFI.

- If the call centre is new, there will be the set up and training costs that need to be recovered for the new product.

- Acquisition expenses are likely to be higher for the new product, e.g. due to additional advertising, etc. Ongoing expenses and contribution to overheads

- This depends on the cost of managing the relationship with People's MFI and service fees to the MFI relative to the cost of administering individual policies.

- The insurer will need to consider the expected business volumes for the existing product (cost of managing the relationship with the MFI) and new product when determining the per policy expense allowance.

- The insurer will incur claims costs that will need to be included in the per policy expense allowance for the new product.

- The insurer will need to recover the development costs of the new product.

- The per policy on-going expenses for the new product may be higher than that of the existing product due to differences in business volumes.

- On the other hand, the introduction of a new product means more policies over which to spread People's Life's fixed overheads, so both products could benefit from a reduced per-policy overhead allocation. Business volumes and mix

- Business volumes for the existing product depend on the number of MFI borrowers.

- In a stable economic and lending environment the number of borrowers and amounts borrowed may increase over time.

- Business volumes for the new product are related to new sales and renewed policies, which is strongly influenced by the level of competition in the market.

- Assumed volumes of new business may initially be lower for the new product compared to the established credit life product, due to competition and the inbound nature of the sales.

- However, over time, the term assurance new business volumes may exceed those of the credit life product owing to a larger market.

- The new product will have lower persistency than the existing product as the existing product is compulsory and linked to a loan, whereas the new policy is voluntary and depends on premium affordability and perceived product need.

- There could be selective lapses towards the end of the term assurance as healthier policyholders begin to expect that they will not die before the end of the term, whereas sicker policyholders will not lapse. Margins

- The margin for risk and profit may need to be increased due to the increase in uncertainty for the new product.

- This can be done either through margins in each of the assumptions above, or in the risk discount rate, or both.

- However, the term assurance is subject to competitive and affordability pressures, which may limit the targeted profit margin, unlike the credit life business. Other

- Investment return and expense inflation assumptions are likely to be similar and of little consequence given the similar short durations and protection nature (assuming re-pricing on an annual basis).

- As noted above, the risk discount rate for the term assurance product may include a margin for the new risks and uncertainties.

- Tax basis is likely to be the same given the same term and mortality protection nature of both contracts.

- Owing to the sales method, there is a greater risk of new business fraud, which could be adjusted for in the pricing.

Premium reviews

- Premiums for credit life policies are not subject to competitive pressures, but still are affected by overall loan repayment + premium affordability.

- Conversely, the insurer may not be able to increase premiums significantly on the term assurance due to competitive and reputational constraints.

- As a result, expected future experience for mortality, expenses and business volumes beyond just one year may need to be considered for the term assurance so that premiums are expected to be sufficient over a longer time period than the initial one-year cover period.

ii. Impact of the free health check-up benefit on the experience of the new product.

- There would be an increase in the overall expenses related to the product due to the costs of providing the check-up.

- Whether there will be an increase in per policy expenses for the policy depends on whether there is an increase in business volumes as a result of the additional benefit.

- There may be an increase in new sales due to the addition of a free attractive product feature.

- The increase in new sales may be short-lived if competitors introduce a similar benefit.

- Lapse rates may increase if the main motivation for policyholders to purchase the policy was the free benefit and they no longer see value in the policy after the annual check-up.

- Alternatively, lapse rates may decrease if it is seen as a valuable benefit that is offered only on those remaining in-force to the end of the term for example. Or if clients find out from the check-up that they are unwell, and so will want to maintain their term assurance.

- There may be a decrease in mortality rates if potentially fatal diseases are picked up early in the health check-ups.

- Conversely, the check-ups could result in healthier lives lapsing and unhealthy lives maintaining cover, leading to an increase in claims experience

- The insurer may be able to get access to anonymised data on the health of policyholders from the health check-up service provider.

distinction between total Rand amounts versus unit amounts. (Clearly, more policies means more Rand expenses or Rand claims, but that does not necessarily mean higher unit costs or higher mortality rates.) Also, there is a distinction between the base assumption versus margins for uncertainty and risk. In other words, a base assumption would be set higher if the experience is expected to be higher for example, which is not the same as an addition of a margin for uncertainty.
Candidates fared better on part ii, being able to identify the key points relating to mortality, persistency and costs. However, a large number indicated premiums must be increased to cater for the cost of the check-up, whereas the question stated the benefit would be free to these customers.

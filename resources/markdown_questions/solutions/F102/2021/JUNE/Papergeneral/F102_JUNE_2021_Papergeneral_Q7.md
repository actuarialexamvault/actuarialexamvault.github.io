## QUESTION 7

i. Determining the model points to use in the model:

- The model points would be chosen in such a way that they represent the mix of endowment assurance business accurately

- Each model point would represent a group of endowment policies with similar features and characteristics of the endowment assurance book.

- E.g. term, cover, premium levels, guarantees, charging methods and levels.

- Different model points would specifically be chosen, to allow for variations in factors that directly affect capital requirements.

- E.g. the level of management charges, mortality levels and the level of investment guarantees.

ii. Description of the model:

- The model would project all expected cashflows associated with a single policy or model point.

- The model would allow for the projection and build-up of the unit account cashflows separately from the non-unit account cashflows.

- The unit account should allow for all potential cashflows, such as:

- premium allocations into the account,

- management expenses out of the account,

- risk charges out of the account,

- surrender penalties out of the account

- The non-unit fund should allow for all potential cashflows, such as:

- Unallocated premium amounts flowing into the fund

- Risk charges flowing into the fund

- Management expense charges flowing into the fund

- Actual expense payments flowing out of the fund

- The cost of supporting any guaranteed benefits such as death benefits flowing out of the fund

- The model would need to allow for actuarial funding if the practice is in use.

- The model would need to make an allowance for any minimum investment return guarantees that may apply to the unit fund.

- The model would then calculate any capital or solvency reserves that need to be set up for the policy, by determining what initial capital amount would need to be added to the non-unit fund at inception of the policy, to ensure there are no projected periods with negative cashflows in the non-unit fund.

- Capital efficiency could be judged by the relative size of the initial capital amount required, when compared to the present value of the premiums under the policy when discounted at the risk discount rate.

- The model would be run for several different model points that represent the various different policy variations, to test the capital efficiency of each group or model point.

iii. Combining stochastic and deterministic modelling:

- When determining the impact of various factors on the level of capital support required by a unit-linked endowment assurance, investment performance is by far the most important.

- Investment performance also lends itself naturally to stochastic modelling.

- You will therefore only model this factor stochastically.

- This will give a wider range of outcomes in terms of investment performance and the resultant level of capital support required.

- Deterministic scenarios can be used to determine the impact of variations in all other factors.

- This will save time and will keep the model simpler.

## QUESTION 8

i. Reasons for policyholders choosing to exercise the option:

- Policyholders in poor health can take advantage of not having to undergo additional underwriting to increase the sum assured for the benefit of their dependants.

- Policyholders may have increased or unexpected financial responsibilities that they want protection for, e.g.:

- an increase in the number of dependants;

- higher loan amounts;

- unanticipated university fees, etc.

- Inflation may have eroded the value of the original benefit.

- The policyholder may not have been able to afford additional cover at outset, but is now able to afford the cover they would ideally have started out with.

ii. Process for performing an investigation into take-up and mortality rates.

- The insurer will need a reasonable volume of stable and consistent data on take up and mortality experience for the option.

- Since the insurer has a large volume of policies; five years of policy data should be sufficient if there has not been a significant change in the insurer's practice over the period.

- Data will need to be divided into homogeneous groups for determining the take-up rates and mortality.

- Factors that could be used to divide data into homogeneous groups for the takeup rates are: age; sex; insurer encouragement to take up the option; sales method.

- Factors that could be used to determine the mortality of policyholders who take up the option are: age; sex; original medical status; sum assured; source of business; smoker status.

- The number of factors used to divide data into groups will be limited by the need to ensure that there is sufficient data in each group for the analysis to be credible.

- Calculation of rates:

- The take-up rate will be calculated as the number of policyholders taking up the option divided by the number of policies reaching the 5th policy anniversary.

- The mortality rate for policyholders will be calculated as the number of deaths divided by exposed to risk for each group.

- The take-up rates and mortality rates calculated may need to be adjusted for any unusual experience or trends in the data.

iii. Expected payments relating to benefits:

- The original sum assured before the option exercise date, based on the mortality of the lives underwritten at inception.

- The original sum assured after the option exercise date for policyholders who do not take up the option, based on the lighter mortality for policyholders who do not take up the option.

- Double the sum assured after the option exercise date for policyholders who take up the option, based on the heavier mortality for policyholders taking up the option. Cashflows relating to expenses.

- Initial expenses at outset, e.g. underwriting, initial commission, etc.

- Regular policy expenses, e.g. administration, for the duration the policy is in-force, subject to inflation.

- Cost of effecting the option at the 5th policy anniversary for policyholders who take up the option.

- Termination expenses for claims underwriting and the processing of death claims. Expected receipts:

- The original premium for the duration that the policy is in-force.

- The additional premium at standard premium rates at the 5th policy anniversary from the option exercise date for policyholders who take up the option.

- There will only be a small investment return as reserves are low. The expected cashflows will depend on the probability that the policy is still in-force i.e. assumed lapse rates

iv. The restrictions are:

- Only allowing exercise at the 5th policy anniversary; and

- Only allowing a doubling of the sum assured.

v. Risks relating to the relaxation of restrictions on the option:

- Relaxation of the restrictions on exercising the options increases the risk of antiselection at the option exercise date:

- More frequent dates to exercise the option increases the risk as there is more opportunity that it will be worthwhile for policyholders to exercise the option given their state of health.

- The impact of anti-selection will also depend on the efforts of the insurer to publicise the option and encourage policyholders to take up the option at option take up dates.

- The greater the take-up rate the lower the anti-selection risk should be.

- If the restrictions were removed on existing business this could result in large losses as the additional cost has not been allowed for in pricing.

- There would be no point increasing the premium on the increased sum assured at option date, as this would only further encourage anti-selection.

- Allowing for the additional anti-selection would result in an increase on new business premiums. This in turn may:

- Make the product uncompetitive.

- Discourage healthy lives from taking out the policy with the option at outset.

- While allowing policyholders to take a lower increase may result in a higher takeup rate, it may also result in a reduction of additional sums assured and hence lower premium income.

- The additional uncertainty in terms of timing and amounts of take-ups will make pricing more difficult. Part (i) was well answered by most candidates. Some did not provide sufficient detail for their reasons to be understood, however. In part (ii) candidates often made imprecise statements, for example relating to how the rates would be calculated. Many candidates explained how the two assumptions would be set instead of explaining how the investigations would be performed. In part (iii) many candidates failed to follow the instruction to "describe", and simply provided a list of the cashflows. No marks were awarded for this. Many candidates claimed that increases/decreases in reserves were cashfllows. A surprising number of candidates thought there could be a surrender value payable and a disturbing number referred to a maturity value, demonstrating a lack of knowledge about the most basic of products. Part (iv) was well answered by almost all candidates. While part (v) was reasonably well answered by most candidates, many seemed to think that the extra premium to be charged would be paid on the additional cover once effected rather than on the underlying contract offering the option.

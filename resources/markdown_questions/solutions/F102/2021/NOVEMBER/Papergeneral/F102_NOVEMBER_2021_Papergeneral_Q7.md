## QUESTION 7

i.
Matching investments:

- A matching strategy should be suitable for the nature, and currency of the liabilities.

- Nature of the liabilities.

- The benefits are fixed in money terms.

- Life office expenses are likely to be real (increasing by a mix of salary and price inflation).

- Term: this depends on when annuities are purchased - typically purchased at retirement so terms can be long (e.g. 30 years) for single-life, and even longer for joint-life.

- Currency: expected to be the same as that of the developing country for benefits and expenses.

- Fixed interest bonds are suitable for most of the liabilities:

- They match fixed benefits by nature.

- Bonds of varying terms are usually available, however sufficiently-long bonds for the longest dated liabilities may not be available in the developing country.

- Government bonds are usually very liquid, even in developing countries, but this may not be true in this country.

- There should be enough supply of local currency bonds for the insurer's liabilities.

- If local bonds of suitable term and liquidity are not available, the life office could consider fixed interest bonds in other countries, and manage the currency risk through hedging instruments.

- However this is only feasible if similar returns are available on foreign bonds, or if annuity pricing reflects foreign bond returns.

- Inflation-linked bonds could be a reasonable match for expenses:

- They match the real nature of expenses.

- However expense inflation might be higher due to wage inflation, however the life company may try to offset this through greater efficiencies.

- To the extent that index linked bonds are not available in sufficient quantities, the life office may consider using other real assets, such as equities.

- However equity returns can be very volatile in the short term, making this asset more suitable for longer-term matching of expense liabilities.

- Cash is liquid and should be held for very short term obligations. ii. Index-linked annuities:

- The nature of the benefits is real and linked to the CPI index.

- Local currency CPI-linked index bonds provide an exact match by nature and currency, if these bonds are available.

- It may be unlikely that bonds of sufficiently long terms are available in the country to match the longest liabilities.

- If the required bonds are not available, the insurer must consider alternative real assets such as equity and property.

- This volatility can be offset to a limited extent by selecting a diversified portfolio of very high quality assets generating a reasonably stable and real income stream.

- A portfolio of direct property is only feasible if the liabilities to be matched are very large, indirect property investments may be considered.

- Offshore real assets may provide an expected real return in local currency terms if the local currency adjusts as expected by purchasing power parity, however in practice this is unlikely over short terms so the insurer faces significant currency risk.

- These alternatives to local index-linked bonds are only feasible if the insurer has sufficient free assets to act as a buffer when returns do not match CPI-linked increases in the liabilities. iii. Adopting a mismatched position:

- In some circumstances, it may be possible to achieve higher returns for shareholders by adopting a mismatched position on the liabilities.

- Without-profit level annuities, which are mostly matched by fixed interest bonds of suitable term, could be backed by assets with higher expected returns for example. equities.

- In other circumstances, it may not be possible to achieve higher returns for shareholders by adopting a mismatched position on the liabilities.

- If without-profit CPI-linked annuities are already backed by equities and property, which provide higher expected returns than other asset classes.

- Shareholder returns might be enhanced by taking a short-term view on asset classes, however this approach is very risky.

- While mismatching assets and liabilities can enhance shareholder returns, it also increases risk to the shareholders.

- Shareholders may not have a high tolerance for risk.

- This higher risk is likely to result in higher solvency capital requirements (so that returns as a percentage of capital needed may not be higher than a lower risk strategy).

- The company may not have sufficient free capital to support a higher risk strategy.

## QUESTION 1

i. Description of the profit testing exercise:

- Project all expected cashflows and profit flows for a single policy, including: ➢ Premiums; ➢ Upfront and regular expenses, including commission payments; ➢ Claim payments; and ➢ Investment income.

- The model would also need to allow for any solvency reserves that need to be set up for the policy.

- Allowance should be made for expected lapses.

- The net projected cashflows would then be discounted at a risk discount rate. ➢ The discount rate should reflect the required return on capital and the risk attaching to the cashflows.

- The model would be run for several different model points to represent different policy variations.

- These results would then need to be grossed up based on the actual business mix and volume.

- The profit may be measured as a net present value, profit margin, internal rate of return or discounted payback period.

- This profit result would then be compared to the targeted profit levels or metric set by the company to determine the adequacy of the premium levels or pricing structure.

- Premium levels and expense loadings will then be varied until targeted profit levels are achieved.

- It is likely that a deterministic model will be used.

ii. Determining the cost of the option:

- The pricing model for term assurance business would be used to determine the premium to be charged for the extended term at standard mortality rates.

- In addition, the pricing model would be used to determine the premium to be charged for the extended term, using the expected mortality experience of policyholders extending their term.

- The model would have to be adjusted to allow for the proportion of lives expected to take up the option.

- Expense charges would be adjusted to allow for: ➢ The cost of the alteration. ➢ The extended premium payment term. ➢ Any associated increases in commission payments.

This question was generally answered well by most candidates.
For part (i) most candidates focused on how to set up model points and derive the assumptions which wasted time as it was not required by the question. In addition, the question specifically asked how to perform the profit test, yet a large number of candidates did not mention profit criteria or how to determine whether the product was profitable.
For part (ii) a number of candidates mentioned the conventional method and North American method but didn't outline how to determine the cost. A number of candidates also mis-read the question and described how you would determine the overall premium with the option rather than determining the cost of the option.

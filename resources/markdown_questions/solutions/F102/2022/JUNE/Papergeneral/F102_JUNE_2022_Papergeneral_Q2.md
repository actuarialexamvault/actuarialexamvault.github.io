## QUESTION 2

i. Exclusions:

- War, terrorism, acts of violence, civil unrest.

- Pre-existing conditions.

- Hazardous past-times or sports.

- Aerial activity other than as a fare-paying passenger.

- Self-inflicted injury or attempted suicide.

- Criminal acts.

- Experimental treatments.

- Cosmetic surgery.

- Failure to seek or follow medical advice.

- Drug or alcohol abuse, although this might be difficult to ascertain.

- Accident and emergency treatment.

- Chronic conditions under PMI.

ii. Reasons for imposing exclusions:

- To manage the anti-selection risk. ➢ E.g. associated with risks that are difficult to assess.

- To simplify and reduce underwriting exclusions or reduce the number of questions on the underwriting form.

- To reduce moral hazard - because of insurance people may be reckless in their behaviour.

- Some risks are difficult to price due to considerable uncertainties. ➢ E.g. participation in a professional sporting event, or war/terrorism risks.

- To reduce costs. ➢ E.g. a typical disability income plan has a deferred period of at least 28 days. This excludes short term claims as a way of reducing the cost in order to make the benefit more affordable to a wider range of potential policyholders.

- It may be poor practice (or even illegal) to provide a benefit. ➢ E.g. if the policyholder is disabled as a result of committing an illegal act.

- Payment may have been received from elsewhere. ➢ May exclude claims for which the policyholder is already receiving compensation (say from an employer or through a structured settlement). ➢ Over insurance could lead to moral hazard which could be difficult to price. This question was answered well by the better prepared candidates. However, the majority of candidates did not provide enough distinct examples in part (i) or provide enough reasons in part (ii) to score well. Furthermore, a number of candidates focused on non-disclosure and reasons to not pay out an insurance claim rather than on exclusions.

## QUESTION 3

i. Factors to consider:
Pricing:

- The premiums charged will need to be sufficient to cover the benefits to be provided and the expenses and provide a profit (in most foreseeable circumstances).

- The current pricing basis will not be relevant to the new target market. ➢ The new target market will include higher numbers of lower salaried bluecollar workers with worse expected mortality experience. ➢ Claim volumes will be higher and expense loadings (especially fixed expense charges) will need to be adjusted appropriately. ➢ Average cover level may differ and the approach to setting free-cover limits may need adjustment.

- A new pricing basis will need to be set, allowing for the differences in mortality experience and expenses expected.

- Any conscious cross-subsidies should be allowed for.

- A consultant or a reinsurer could help with the pricing.

- If the insurer gets the pricing wrong, because these are large schemes, it may impact its solvency.

- Competitiveness and marketability may be in conflict with profitability and solvency. Administration:

- With larger schemes there will be higher volumes of administration, underwriting, and claims management.

- It may be necessary to develop new administration systems/processes, e.g. new underwriting skills will be required.

- The insurer will need to ensure that it has sufficient resources to perform these services.

- The insurer will need to decide whether the existing distribution channel is appropriate, and what administration will be carried out by the channel.

ii. Benefits of reinsurance:

- Limit the amount paid on any single claim, this may be important for senior executives with high benefits.

- Protect against aggregations of risk caused by having lots of workers in the same building and possibly exposed to dangerous substances or fire. ➢ This risk may be higher for the new target market compared to the existing market

- Limit total claims payout in a period through stop loss reinsurance

- Reduce insurance parameter risk, which could be important as the insurer is entering a new market.

- Reduce claim payout fluctuations.

- Receive technical assistance, important for the expanding business where the insurer has no experience, such as: ➢ Access to data, which could be used for pricing or reserving. ➢ Access to pricing models or bases. ➢ Assistance with underwriting and administration if new business volumes are significant.

- Reduce new business strain by reducing solvency requirements or through financial reinsurance

- Increase profits, return or risk-adjusted return on capital (by reducing risk cost or increasing volumes).

- Reduce the overall capital requirements by using a reinsurer's capital.

- Allow the insurer to separate out different risks from a product allowing the insurer to optimise its risk management and capital requirements.

- A financing arrangement with a reinsurer could help improve the insurer's solvency position.

iii. Initial underwriting for group life compared to individual life insurance:

- For group life there is a very low risk of anti-selection, as the cover is likely to be compulsory, and hence underwriting can be more lenient in general.

- For individuals, financial underwriting is important and proof of income could be required.

- For group life, no financial underwriting is required as the benefits are based on an individual's salary.

- For group life there would be a Free Cover Limit, and covers below this would not need to be underwritten.

- There would be an "actively at work" clause for group covers, which reduces the risk of anti-selection. ➢ If someone is not at work they may need to go for underwriting.

- For cover above the FCL, group underwriting could be similar to individual. ➢ However, it is likely to be simplified, perhaps with just a health questionnaire

- You do not need to underwrite for occupation in group life as that is allowed for in the pricing. Part (i) was answered very well by most candidates. There were many points that could have been made. Candidates who set out their answer clearly, dealing with pricing and administration separately, generally scored well. Part (ii) was also generally well answered. It required applying bookwork to the specific details given in the question. Most candidates were able to identify the main differences in underwriting approaches for part

(iii).

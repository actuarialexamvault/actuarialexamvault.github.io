## QUESTION 5

i. Surrender values should:

- Take into account policyholder's reasonable expectations.

- At early durations, not appear too low compared with premiums paid (taking into account any projections given at new business stage).

- At later durations, be consistent with projected maturity values.

- Not exceed earned asset share, in aggregate, over a reasonable time period. ➢ Make an appropriate contribution to profit, if possible (and consistent with the other objectives). ➢ Treat leavers and the continuing policyholders fairly.

- Take account of surrender values offered by competitors.

- Not be subject to: ➢ Frequent change, unless dictated by financial conditions; or ➢ Discontinuities over the duration of a policy.

- Not be excessively complicated to explain to policyholders or to calculate, taking into account the computing powers available.

- Be capable of being documented clearly.

- Avoid selection against the insurer, including lapse and re-entry risks.

- Take account of auction values that may be available.

- Comply with regulatory and professional requirements.

- Appropriately allow for the cost of administering the surrender.

ii. Suitability:

- The prospective policy value on a realistic basis is likely to be negative for an extended period of time because premiums are relatively small initially (increasing over time). ➢ The proposal would therefore result in no surrender value for a relatively long time. ➢ This is particularly true for young policyholders (as they have long expected policy durations and mortality rates that do not increase much at younger ages).

- As a result, the proposal may lead to policyholder dissatisfaction (if they expect a surrender value similar to premiums paid to date). ➢ This may be problematic depending on the market practice in providing surrender values at early durations on whole life policies.

➢ It is likely that the policy value on a realistic basis will generally be less than the EAS, making the surrender value affordable (when the EAS is positive). ➢ This also means that it is possible that no surrender value is payable even when the EAS is positive.

- The EAS is however likely to be negative for an extended period of time. ➢ The company will then make a loss on surrender. ➢ In this context, paying no surrender value at early durations minimises the loss on surrender while the EAS is negative.

- The difference between the EAS and the surrender value represents: ➢ The accumulated value of profit made to date; plus ➢ the present value of profit expected to arise in the future from the difference in the assumptions in the pricing basis and surrender value basis.

- The profit extracted on surrender is therefore consistent with the profit the company would have made had the policy stayed in force. ➢ This is generous to shareholders (although they are exposed to lapse risk). ➢ Leavers and the continuing policyholders are being treated equitably. ➢ Policyholders that surrender may view taking credit for future profit as being excessive. ➢ The proposal results in a cross-subsidy between surrenders at early durations (when the policy value is negative) and those at late durations.

- Surrenders are being discouraged: ➢ At early durations because no surrender value is paid while the policy value is negative. ➢ At later durations, because the surrender value is relatively small (due to the use of a realistic basis).

- Because policy values are calculated on a realistic basis: ➢ The surrender values may be volatile over time because realistic bases are likely to change relatively frequently. ➢ There may be discontinuities over policy duration (when the basis is changed). ➢ It should avoid surrender and re-entry risk because the current pricing basis will be more prudent than a realistic basis.

- The surrender values will tend to the death benefit at longer durations.

- The surrender value is likely to be consistent with auction values that are generally calculated using the prospective method (although the assumptions used are likely to be different).

- It will also not be clear, up front, when surrender values first become payable, which may be difficult to explain to policyholders.

- The calculations should be relatively easy because the same methodology is likely to be used for setting up reserves, and it is not necessary to keep track of past experience. ➢ However, setting and reviewing a realistic basis frequently can be challenging.

Most candidates struggled with part (ii). Candidates that did well in this part, were able to demonstrate a clear understanding of the progression of the policy value over the duration of the contract, the impact of the premium structure on the policy value and the relative values of the asset share and policy value (and did not use these two phrases interchangeably). Common errors included making generic comments (which already received credit in part (i)) or just reproducing material from the notes without taking the context of the question into account, for example many candidates suggested that there would be a maturity value on the whole life contract. Some candidates incorrectly suggested that there is a surrender penalty applicable to conventional products.

## QUESTION 6

i. Consumer needs met:

- Converts a capital sum into a level income for the future lifetime of the policyholder.

- Useful for providing an income in retirement.

- The level annuity satisfies the need for certainty of income amount.

- The annual once-off bonuses could provide some compensation to annuitants for the increase on the cost of living.

- The annual dividend could satisfy the need for discretionary spending, some other annual outlay, or for unexpected costs.

- If there is a guarantee period or a spouse's annuity, this can provide for dependants on death of the annuitant. Risks to an annuitant:

- The guaranteed benefit remains level over time and thus becomes less valuable over time due to inflation. ➢ There is a risk that the benefit level turns out to be insufficient to cover living expenses over time.

- The amounts of the annual dividends are uncertain: ➢ This makes financial planning difficult. ➢ Dividend increases (if any) may be unrelated to inflation over time.

- Dividends could be low due to factors such as: ➢ low investment returns. ➢ higher than expected longevity; or ➢ higher than expected expenses and expense inflation.

- The annuitant may mismanage the money they receive and run out of cash between annual payments.

- There is a risk that the company becomes insolvent and unable to meet its obligations to annuitants.

- There is a risk that the product is poor value for money if the policyholder dies early and there is no guarantee period or spouse's annuity.

- The product is inflexible and cannot change to accommodate changing needs.

iii. Surplus arises from:

- Investment return surplus: Excess of actual investment return (over expected) on the assets at the beginning of the year, that is higher returns than expected.

- Mortality surplus: Expected annuity payments less actual annuity payments based on the mortality of policyholders, that is more deaths than expected.

- Expense surplus: Excess of expected expenses over actual expenses, that is lower expenses than expected. Factors to consider:

- The timing of the benefit payments and expenses should be considered by allowing for the loss of excess investment return.

- The surplus should be calculated separately for homogeneous groups. ➢ For example, amount of level annuity; age group at policy inception or duration in-force. ➢ Need to ensure equity between different groups.

- Historical information needs to be kept on the premium bases for assessing expected experience.

- The amount of surplus to distribute in any given year, depending on what is specified in the contract, for example: ➢ A proportion of the total surplus will be declared as the annual cash dividend, and the remainder might be retained by the insurer to be distributed to shareholders or to meet other business objectives ➢ A proportion could also be used to fund a reserve for adverse circumstances and to support smoothing of bonuses.

- The insurer should ensure that the majority of the retained surplus is distributed over the lifetime of the policy as there would be no terminal bonuses for this business.

- Policyholders' reasonable expectations regarding the level of dividends, based on marketing material and past practise, amongst other things.

- Whether or how much of the surplus arising is non-recurring, and how to distribute that - for example declare as a special dividend to not create expectations.

- What competitors are doing or level of dividends on similar products, in order to remain competitive (supports new business sales and reduces complaints).

iii. Expense investigation:

- The first step is to identify all actual expenses over the year according to source of expense (e.g. cost centre).

- Expenses can be divided into initial, renewal, termination (possibly) and investment expenses.

- Can also determine whether expenses are proportional to: size of single premium, size of annuity payment, funds under management, or number of policies.

- Commission expenses are excluded.

- Investment expenses can be accounted for through a reduction in the investment yield and could be excluded further from the investigation.

- The key expense items can be allocated to the relevant cells as follows: ➢ Salary costs for staff only responsible for the with-profits annuity business can be fully allocated to the business. ➢ Timesheets can be used to split salary costs for staff responsible for multiple lines of business. ➢ Other staff not attributable to any particular lines of business (e.g. general management) can be allocated to overheads and apportioned pragmatically. ➢ Property costs can take the form of actual rent or notional rent (in the case of owner-occupied buildings). ➢ Property costs can be divided by the area occupied by each department (i.e. using floor space) and allocated into functional cells in the same proportions as salary costs. ➢ Computer costs take the form of amortised new computer costs and ongoing costs. ➢ Computer costs can be divided by usage of computers/ number of staff. ➢ Once-off capital costs can be amortised and treated as overheads. ➢ Exceptional once-off costs can be excluded if these are deemed to be nonrecurring. ➢ Overheads should be allocated in a pragmatic way e.g. in proportion to the allocation of direct expenses. ➢ Marketing expenses can be allocated to the annuity product in proportion to size of new business premiums for example.

- The insurer may further consider separating the expenses into homogeneous groups of policies for calculating dividends where experience is expected to differ by group. ➢ However, it is unlikely that expense experience will differ across homogeneous tranches of annuities.

- The reasonability of the results of the expense investigation can be checked by: ➢ Comparing the sum of the expense allocations to different lines of business to total expenses in the accounts. ➢ Comparing allocated expenses for the current year to previous years, investigating trends and expense inflation. Overall, this question was reasonably well answered by most candidates. Parts (i) and (ii) were mostly well answered, although many generic points were made in part

(ii) which did not gain credit.
While many candidates performed well on part (iii), a straightforward application question, a number did poorly. This may have been due to poor time management in some cases.

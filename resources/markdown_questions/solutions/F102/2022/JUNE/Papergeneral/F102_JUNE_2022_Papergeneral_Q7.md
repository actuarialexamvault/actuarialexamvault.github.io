## QUESTION 7

i. Advantages:

- Assumptions are updated regularly and based on market conditions, thus are more relevant.

- The new approach provides information on the impact of market conditions on the ability of the insurer to meet its obligations to policyholders.

- The gross premium valuation method allows explicit future bonuses and expenses to be included, leading to reserves that are more appropriate and reflective of specific circumstances. Disadvantages:

- More complex than passive valuation approaches and more costly to calculate.

- Results are more volatile compared to passive valuation approaches.

- Investment markets in the small, developing country may be illiquid making it difficult to set some market-consistent assumptions.

ii. Relative weaknesses of current approach:

- The solvency requirements are not explicitly based on a specified level of confidence of breaching solvency levels within a defined period of time, unlike a Value at Risk (VaR) approach.

- This makes risk management more difficult e.g. cannot easily define company risk tolerance.

- If based on experience in other countries, the factors may not be suitable for this country.

- The factors do not reflect the quality and extent of risk management, while this is likely to be reflected in a VaR approach.

- The factors do not fully capture policyholder risk profiles within classes e.g. mortality and lapse risks.

- The factors are unlikely to be updated regularly under a passive approach, thus may quickly become out of date compared to an active VaR approach.

- The asset discount factors are unlikely to adequately allow for differences in credit and illiquidity risk.

- The method does not clearly indicate the level (if any) of diversification between risks allowed for.

iii. Data required:

- Policy data for all the term assurance policies are required including: ➢ Date of inception; age of policyholder and sum insured

- Model points might be used instead of actual data, however this might not be necessary given the small size of the portfolio. Assumptions required:

- Mortality rate; lapse rate; expenses incl. renewal expenses, claim expenses and expense inflation; investment and discount rate. Setting the discount rate:

- The discount rate will be based on risk free-rates.

- The risk-free rates will be based on the yield of government bonds of appropriate term.

- Adjustments may be needed for short-term anomalies.

- The insurer should use term-dependent rates based on the yield curve for government bonds.

- A yield curve may not be available for the term of all the insurance liabilities (although it is unlikely that 15-year bonds are unavailable).

- The insurer may therefore need to extrapolate the yield curve.

- Since this is a small developing country it is unlikely that a deep market for swaps will exist.

- It is unlikely that the insurer would be able to take credit for the illiquidity premium in corporate bonds due to the difficulty of matching liabilities given the small portfolio of term assurance policies and hence variability of experience, as well as the likely small corporate bond market in this small developing country.

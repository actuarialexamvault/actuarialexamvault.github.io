## QUESTION 8

i. Charges:

- Policy fee (fixed) deducted from premiums or from the unitised fund.

- Percentage premium allocation (possibly lower during an initial period to cover the higher initial expenses, higher thereafter).

- Bid-offer spread.

- Risk benefit charge.

- Surrender penalty.

ii. a. Mortality risk:

- The company is exposed to the risk that the number of deaths is higher than what it expected and priced for.

- The risk is higher where only limited underwriting is done with the short health questionnaire as limited underwriting is unlikely to capture sufficient health details of the policyholder to make an accurate estimate of mortality.

- The company is therefore exposed to an anti-selection risk.

- If selective withdrawals from healthy lives are more than expected this would also pose a mortality risk.

- The annual policy fee may not be sufficient to cover the mortality costs as well as all other costs, e.g. ➢ If a greater-than-expected number of policyholders opt for the higher cover (assuming this will have a higher cost). ➢ If the average age of policyholders is greater than expected.

- As this is a new insurer, it is unlikely to have much experience in these products, exacerbating the mortality risk.

- Small volumes of business, likely with a new insurer, would also increase this risk.

- The fact that the policy term is long (20 years) also exacerbates the mortality risk. ➢ However, the risk will reduce over time as the unitised fund builds up.

b. Expense risk:

- The risk is that the total charge is inadequate to cover the cost of administration and other expenses.

- The risk is exacerbated by the fact that there is a mismatch in both nature and timing between the charges and the expenses.

- The company is also exposed to the risk of inflation being higher than expected on the administration and overhead expenses over the long term of the policies: ➢ The extent of this risk will depend on how closely matched investment growth is to expense inflation.

- As the company is new it will have less knowledge of expected costs, increasing the expense risk.

- There is a risk that initial expenses might not be recouped if fund growth is not as expected.

- There is a risk that more policyholders than expected opt for the additional (and hence more expensive) underwriting at inception.

- If the company writes less business than assumed, and as a new company this is a significant risk, it might not have sufficient policies on the books to cover its overheads.

- Similarly if withdrawals are higher than expected prior to initial expenses having been recouped.

c. Investment risk:

- The risk is that investment returns are lower than expected and guaranteed bonuses cannot be met on surrender or maturity.

- Poorer than expected investment growth has several risks: ➢ Lower than expected charges for the company. ➢ Poor investment performance will lead to lower bonus rates and could lead to reputational damage, terminations and reduced new business.

- The zero market value reduction poses an investment risk to the insurer, as it would be exposed to an anti-selection risk of surrenders after a market crash.

- The company is exposed to the credit risk on the counterparty of the derivative instruments used to match the guaranteed maturity value (if over-the-counter instruments are used).

In part (ii) several candidates did not provide a description as required, but simply listed items such as anti-selection. This does not answer the question and did not gain credit. Overall the better prepared candidates scored reasonably well on this question.
In part (ii) the better candidates performed well, but generally too few distinct points were made. several candidates failed to make it clear that it is experience being worse than expected which poses risk rather than "high expenses" etc. Some answers to this part (and others) were very badly written, making it difficult to understand the points being made.

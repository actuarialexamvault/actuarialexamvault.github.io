## QUESTION 1

i. Assumptions required:
Mortality:

- The base mortality assumptions will be needed.

- An assumption on the level of expected future mortality improvements will be needed.

- The assumptions should be based on the expected demographic profile of the policyholders and have regard to recent mortality experience investigations which the company has conducted.

- Since it is a supervisory reserve performed on a prudent basis, the prudential margin would be a reduction in the base mortality, and larger future mortality improvements (as it is more prudent to assume fewer lives die for an immediate annuity). Benefit inflation:

- A benefit inflation assumption will be required since it is an inflation-linked annuity.

- This could be based on the expected future rates of inflation based on the differential between the government fixed interest securities and government index-linked securities i.e. the difference between the nominal and real curve. Valuation rate of interest

- A valuation rate of interest will be required which should take into consideration the yield on the government or corporate bonds (taking default risk into account).

- The prudential margin which should be included would be a reduction in the valuation rate of interest. OR Valuation rate of interest net of benefit increases:

- A valuation rate of interest will be required which should take into consideration the yield on the government or corporate inflation-linked bonds (taking default risk into account) as these are the likely assets which the entity will use to match these liabilities with.

- This automatically allows for benefit increases matched to the index used by the bond.

- This may not be appropriate if the lags on the increases are different.

- It may also not be appropriate if different indices are used.

Expenses:

- An allowance for expenses needs to be included which should reflect the expenses expected to be incurred in administering the annuities.

- This should also include a share of marginal/variable as well as overhead expenses.

- An explicit assumption will be required to allow for future inflation of expenses, which could be based on: ➢ Current rates of inflation which can be based on recent actual experience of the life insurance company; or ➢ As for benefit increases, use the difference between the nominal and real curve.

- The prudential margin would be an increase in expense and expense inflation assumption. Withdrawals:

- Since it is an immediate annuity, withdrawal assumptions are not applicable.

ii. Mortality:

- The assumptions should be based on the expected demographic profile of the policyholders.

- The insurer likely can't use its own experience for this newly launched product.

- The target market may be different to the annuity book.

- Age profile would be broader.

- The prudential margin would need to be an increase in the base mortality (as opposed to the decrease used on the annuity product).

- May want different mortality tables for each premium option. ➢ E.g. if target markets are different or expect more anti-selection on age-related premiums.

- May use information from a reinsurer to assist with setting the mortality basis.

- Another external data source could perhaps be used (e.g. industry data) but the insurer would need to adjust for its expected business mix.

- In addition, the insurer may want to include some additional margin given the uncertainty around the new product.

- If the age-related premiums are reviewable, this margin could be reduced. Withdrawal:

- Withdrawal is quite a material assumption.

- Given the different premium pattern options, the insurer might find it necessary to have different withdrawal assumptions for the different premium patterns.

- Since level premium policies go through a 'pre-funding' stage where premiums are generally higher than the equivalent age-rated premium and hence the withdrawal assumption may be higher.

- Hence, for age-rated policies, the direction of the margin would be an increase in the withdrawal assumption.

- However, for level premium policies it would depend on the stage of the policy that the policy is in. If it is in the "pre-funded" stage, then an increase in the withdrawal assumption would introduce prudence.

- However, once they are in the "funded" stage i.e. where the level premium is insufficient to cover the actual claims cost then it would be prudent to decrease the withdrawal assumption. Expenses:

- Considerations will largely be similar to those for setting the assumptions for annuities described above.

- However, immediate annuities are often not underwritten at all but the company will need to underwrite the whole of life assurance leading to higher initial costs.

- The insurer may need to include an assumption for initial expenses, commission and commission clawbacks which will be material for the whole of life product.

- Renewal expenses will need to be estimated as these expenses (regular premium collection, etc.) will differ from those for annuities (relating to annuity payments).

- The insurer will need to allow for expenses at claim stage which would not have been applicable under the annuity contract. In part (i) the majority of candidates were able to describe each key assumption. Candidates who performed particularly well on the question focused on explaining the margins that would be incorporated into each assumption and importantly which direction that margin would be applied as opposed to just talking about "adding margins" as a general point. Part (ii) was generally not well answered, with most attempts being too general and without focusing on the specific considerations within each of the assumptions for the different premium payment groups. In addition, due to the product being a whole life product (as opposed to the annuity in part (i)), the direction of the margins for particular assumptions may be different.

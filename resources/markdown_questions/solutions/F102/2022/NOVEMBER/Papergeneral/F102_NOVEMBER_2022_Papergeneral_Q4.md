## QUESTION 4

i. Benefits for the company:

- May bring the product in line with those of competitors or make it more appealing in the market. ➢ This may lead to increased sales and profits for the company. As it could result in designing a more appealing or easier understood solution to clients or advisers, ➢ This would reduce the likelihood of new business volumes being insufficient to cover the company's initial expenses.

- The company may be able to implement charges that are more easily reviewable

- It may also be able to formulate new (and easier to achieve) policyholder reasonable expectations.

- The company may be able to implement a more capital efficient product. ➢ E.g. reduce guarantees; or implement higher initial charges.

- The unitised with-profits product may increase operational efficiency ➢ E.g. The current administration systems, distribution and other processes for unit-linked business may only require minor changes to cater for the new product range. Benefits to new policyholders:

- The new product is easier to understand and more transparent than the conventional product. ➢ As fees are explicit and bonuses may be more easily understood in terms of value of units

- There is usually less smoothing in unitised with-profits business, so it may be more equitable to different cohorts of policyholders

- The company may be able to offer more choice, e.g. by level of risk/return tradeoff and level of guarantees.

- The lower level of guarantees compared to the conventional product may provide greater investment freedom to pursue higher expected return investments leading to better returns for policyholders. Benefits to existing policyholders:

➢ This would result in a more equitable distribution to existing clients who contributed to the surplus.
ii. Investigations and associated action:

- Investigate whether any mistakes were made in the initial analysis to determine the actual expenses per policy (e.g. data used is all correct). ➢ E.g. Initial expenses misclassed as renewal expenses.

- Check for once-off items. ➢ If this is causing a distortion no remedial action may be required. ➢ However, anticipated once-off expenses should be accounted for in the charging structure or bonuses.

- Check whether the deviation is significant in terms of absolute size. ➢ For a small book, no immediate action may be taken.

- Check whether higher expenses per policy are due to expenses exceeding the expected level, or due to lower than expected business volumes, or both. ➢ Past budgets and business plans may be useful sources for comparing against actual experience (expenses and business volumes). ➢ Higher-than-expected expenses should be investigated to identify specific drivers and sources, and whether these can be managed in future, e.g. through cost-cutting exercises. ➢ If business volumes are lower-than-expected then causes for this should be investigated and whether this trend is likely to continue.

- E.g. higher than expected withdrawals or lower than expected new business may have led to lower overall volumes.

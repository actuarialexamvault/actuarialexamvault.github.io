## QUESTION 5

i. Actuarial funding:

- This is the method that a life insurance company can use to reduce the size of the "unit reserves" it needs to hold in respect of its unit-linked business.

- The company effectively capitalizes some or all of the unit-related charges it expects to receive from the units it has nominally allocated, with the funding then being repaid from these future charges as they are received.

- When associated with appropriate surrender penalties it enables the company to: ➢ reduce its financing requirements because initial expenses are matched in terms of time and nature.

ii. Surrender values should:

- Take into account policyholder's reasonable expectations.

- At early durations, not appear too low compared with premiums paid (taking into account any projections given at new business stage).

- At later durations, be consistent with projected maturity values.

- Not exceed earned asset share, in aggregate, over a reasonable time period. ➢ Make an appropriate contribution to profit, if possible (and consistent with the other objectives).

- Take account of surrender values offered by competitors.

- Not be subject to ➢ frequent change, unless dictated by financial conditions. ➢ discontinuities over the duration of a policy.

- Not be excessively complicated to calculate, taking into account the computing powers available nor explain to policyholders.

- Be capable of being documented clearly.

- Avoid selection against the insurer, including lapse and re-entry risks.

- Take account of auction values that may be available.

- Comply with regulatory and professional requirements.

- Appropriately allow for the cost of administering the surrender.

iii. a. Impact on ability to actuarially fund:

- Both designs include unit-related penalties, which will allow the company to actuarially fund units.

- Under both designs the maximum rate that can be used in the funding-factor is 0.2% (the fund management charge in respect of initial expenses).

- Under B, the actuarial funding factors will be limited to a maximum term of 10 years.

b. Fairness:

- To policyholders that surrender: ➢ Both surrender penalties reduce over time (as a percentage of fund value), which is reasonable as initial expenses are being repaid over time. ➢ Under A, the surrender penalty is approximately equal to the future management charges (in respect of the initial expenses) the company will not receive, which seems fair. ➢ Under B, there is a relatively large penalty at early durations, which may not be viewed as fair to early leavers. ➢ Under B, no surrender penalty at later durations may be overly generous to policyholders that lapse at these durations. ➢ However, this may be appropriate as the insurer would have likely recovered a large portion of the initial expenses incurred.

- To policyholders that do not surrender: ➢ Under A, the initial expenses are recovered, and therefore policyholders that do not lapse should largely be unaffected by surrenders. ➢ Under B there is an under-recovery for late surrenders.

- If these losses are passed on to other policyholders through higher policy charges (compared to A), this may not be seen as fair.

- To shareholders : ➢ Under A, shareholders are not compensated for the loss of future profits. This may be viewed as unfair. ➢ Under B:

- Shareholders would receive some profit on surrender on very early surrenders.

- e.g. 0.4% × 10 = 4% of fund value > 0.2% × 15 = 3% of fund value.

- Shareholders would not be compensated for (some of) the lost future charges, which could be unfair. ➢ Under B, there is a cross-subsidy between policyholders that surrender early and those that surrender later.

- B therefore exposes the shareholder to more risk, (due to it being less capital efficient and the cross-subsidy risk).

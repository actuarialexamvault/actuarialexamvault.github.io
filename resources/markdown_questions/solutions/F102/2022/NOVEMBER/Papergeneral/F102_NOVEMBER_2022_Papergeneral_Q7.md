## QUESTION 7

i. Conditions may include:

- The sum of the unit and non-unit reserves for a policy should not be less than any guaranteed surrender value.

- The future profits arising on a policy with a negative non-unit reserve need to emerge in time to repay the "loan".

- After taking account of the future non-unit reserves, there are no future negative cashflows for the policy i.e. there should be no future valuation strain.

- In aggregate, the sum of all non-unit reserves (including from other business) should not be negative.

- Negative non-unit reserves cannot be used to offset unit reserves.

ii. Accounting information:
Revenue account:

- Premium income

- Investment income

- Charges collected (from premiums and unit-linked)

- Claims outgo (death, maturity, surrender)

- Expenses outgo (commissions, life office costs)

- Tax outgo Balance sheet:

- Asset values (including current assets)

- Accounting provisions (including current liabilities) Fund management information: Overall and per fund if more than one fund:

- Asset values for the fund (including a breakdown of holdings and their values)

- Investment income (e.g. dividends, interest, rental)

- Capital gains (realised and unrealised)

- Net cashflows received for investment or paid out (e.g. to meet claims)

- Transaction costs paid from fund assets

iii. Data checks:
Accounts versus Fund manager information

- Fund manager net cashflows compared to cashflows from the accounts e.g. net cashflow ~ premiums received - claims - expenses - tax (from accounts).

- Fund manager investment income compared to investment income shown in the accounts should be consistent. Accounts versus data extracts

- Assets (from accounts) ~ number of units (in force) x unit price at valuation date.

- Accounts death benefit outgo ≥ sum of unit values for deaths (in movements file). ➢ And/or accounts death outgo ~ number of deaths (movements file) x average death benefit (taken as max of SA and unit value; from in-force file).

- Accounts maturity benefit outgo ≥ sum of unit values for maturities (in movements file). ➢ And/or accounts maturity outgo ~ number of maturities (movements file) x average unit value (in-force file).

- Accounts surrender benefit outgo < sum of unit values for surrenders (in movements file).

- Check internal unit movements (e.g. charge encashments, such as expense and mortality charges deducted from policyholders' funds by cancelling units) are consistent with surplus emerging during the year (from Accounts). Fund manager information versus data extract files

- Fund manager total returns should be consistent with the increase in unit price.

iv. Possible reasons:

- A positive non-unit reserve implies that future expected charges are not sufficient to meet expected non-unit fund outgo (including expenses and benefits in excess of the unit fund).

- As assumptions have remained unchanged, an increase in non-unit reserve will likely have occurred due to unfavourable experience.

- Poor (possibly negative) investment returns over the year: ➢ This leads to lower fund values, which in turn leads to lower fund-related charges expected in future without a corresponding decrease in future expenses. ➢ Lower fund values increase the value of the maturity guarantees which may need to be paid from the non-unit fund. ➢ Lower fund values increase the value of death benefits to be paid from the nonunit fund (resulting in a positive non-unit reserve if mortality charges are nonreviewable and insufficient to cover expected death benefits). ➢ Lower fund values decrease the value of future fund-based surrender charges.

- Expenses per policy may have increased unexpectedly during the year: ➢ This increases the value of future expenses to be paid from the non-unit fund which may not be matched by increasing charges.

- A greater than expected number of policies being made paid-up: ➢ This results in a loss of future charges had the policy not gone paid-up due to lower future fund values. ➢ It also increases the value of maturity guarantees as the unit fund will not grow as quickly as before.

and swapped around their explanations, i.e. wrote about how investment returns might have been better than expected etc.

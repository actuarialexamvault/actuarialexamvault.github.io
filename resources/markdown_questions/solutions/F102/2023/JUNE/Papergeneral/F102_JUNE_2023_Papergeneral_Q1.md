## QUESTION 1

i. Key investment principles:

- In order to minimise risk, a company should select investments that match the liabilities.

- Matching should consider the nature, term and currency of the assets and liabilities.

- The investments should also be selected to maximise the overall return on the assets, where overall return includes both investment income and capital gains.

- The extent to which the appropriate investments referred to above may be departed from in order to maximise the overall return will depend, inter alia, on the extent of the company's free assets.

ii. a. Without-profits whole life assurance:

- The whole life insurance benefits are fixed in monetary terms and will primarily be backed by fixed interest government bonds.

- Bonds of suitable term and local currency will be selected to match the expected cashflows on the whole of life contracts. b. Without-profits immediate annuities:

- Immediate annuity payments are fixed in monetary terms (whether level payments or fixed increases) and will be primarily backed by fixed interest bonds.

- Bonds of suitable term and local currency will be selected to match expected annuity payments. For both types of contract:

- Due to the long-term nature of whole life assurance and some annuity contracts (e.g. life annuities) it may be difficult to find bonds of sufficiently long term to match the benefits, in which case a best match will be acceptable.

- The insurer will need to invest in some equities to provide a real return to meet expected expenses over the longer term and to match liabilities with a longer term than the longest dated bonds.

iii. Modelling the cost of the investment guarantee:

- One would mainly model future returns earned on the bonds and equities stochastically.

- This will be done by first selecting appropriate distribution function(s) and parameters that represent the likely future returns on the bond and equity portfolios. ➢ For example, a lognormal distribution could be used and a back testing approach followed to determine the suitable parameters - or by purchasing standard simulated returns that have been modelled appropriately.

- For each simulation the unit fund is projected to maturity date on both the minimum guaranteed return and projected investment returns.

- The cost of the guarantee would then be represented as the difference, at maturity, between the projected unit funds, where the former (based on the minimum guarantee return) is higher than the latter. ➢ In cases where the reverse is true, the cost of the guarantee would be zero.

- The average across all the simulation runs would then represent the expected cost of the guarantee.

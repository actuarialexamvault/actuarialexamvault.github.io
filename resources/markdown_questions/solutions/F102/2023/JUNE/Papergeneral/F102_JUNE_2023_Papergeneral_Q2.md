## QUESTION 2

i. Options available:

- Decline to offer the cover if the condition is very serious and irreversible.

- Defer the decision till you have more information on a condition that may stabilise or improve or send the applicant for further specialised tests.

- Add a loading to the premium, either a flat loading (for aviation, say), or a percentage loading for conditions that are more serious as one ages (most health conditions).

- Limit the sum insured offered.

- Impose an exclusion for the condition that you are concerned about.

ii. Role of claims underwriting:

- The main role is to ensure that only valid claims are paid, with others being repudiated.

- The insurer will check that: ➢ There is a valid death certificate. ➢ The death was not from a condition that was specifically excluded. ➢ There is no evidence of non-disclosure. ➢ The policyholder has paid their premiums.

- If a claim looks suspicious the claims team will have to gather additional information. ➢ This could be medical reports from the claimant's doctor. This would include medication, hospital visits etc.

- The claims team would also check for aggregation of covers to ensure that the policyholder didn't have multiple policies with various insurers. ➢ If over-insurance is suspected the claims team can gather additional information on the financial status of the claimant prior to death (e.g. income, assets and liabilities etc).

iii. Catastrophe reinsurance operates as follows:

- The reinsuring company will agree to pay out if a "catastrophe", as defined in the reinsurance contract, occurs.

- The cover is usually only available on a yearly renewable basis and must be renegotiated each year.

- A typical definition of what constitutes a catastrophe is that there needs to be a minimum number, say five, deaths from a single incident with the deaths occurring within a specified time, say 48 hours of that incident.

- The reinsuring company's liability in respect of a single catastrophe claim would be subject to a maximum amount and any amount above this would revert to the cedant.

- There is also usually a maximum amount of cover per life. Managing the risk:

- As the insurer has many policyholders living or working in close proximity, if there is a catastrophe and many policyholders die it will be able to claim from the reinsurer

- This will protect the insurer against large once-off claim payments which will prevent a once off large reduction in profits, or possible insolvency. Part (i) was a simple application question and was well answered by most candidates. Part (ii) was mostly well answered. However, several candidates confused fraud with antiselection, that is suggesting claims underwriting detects anti-selection. Claims underwriting detects fraud but not anti-selection, which is permissible and depends on the product design and pricing. Knowingly giving false information on an application form is fraudulent but selecting against the insurer is not. Part (iii) was not well answered for what was an easy question. Candidates failed to know the basic operation of catastrophe reinsurance. Some gave generic benefits of reinsurance which was not required. Many did not relate the answer about managing the risk to the particular situation at hand.

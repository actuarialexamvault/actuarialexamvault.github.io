## QUESTION 3

i. Inception / disabled life approach:

- The inception / disabled life annuity approach makes use of two functions, the claim inception rate and the disabled life annuity to value the benefit.

- The claim inception rate is the probability that a claim will become payable to an individual in the year of age x to x+1. ➢ Provided that the individual remains sick to the end of the deferred period.

- In order to derive the claim inception rate, one must multiply the sickness inception rate by the probability of remaining sick throughout the deferred period.

- Allowance is made for any escalation of the benefit amount, interest and the probabilities of death and recovery between the end of the deferred period and the policy expiry date.

- The expected claims outgo is then calculated as the annual benefit amount multiplied by the disabled life annuity multiplied by the claim inception rate.

ii. Multi-state modelling approach:

- The multi-state modelling approach tracks policyholders through various stages of healthy and claiming as follows: ➢ Healthy premium payers. ➢ Lives falling sick within the deferred period. ➢ Lives becoming claimants following the deferred period. ➢ Lives recovering, reverting to premium payers. ➢ Lives dying.

- Each subclass requires its own set of transition probabilities.

- These transition probabilities may vary according to the number of previous times that the cohort has been ill and all transition rates may be a function of the duration within that stage.

- In addition to the transition probabilities, assumptions regarding the proportion of lives in each state will be required.

- The value of claims outgo will depend on the number of lives in the benefitreceiving states, in a given month.

- Premium income will depend on the number of lives in the premium-paying states, in a given month.

- Investment income and all expenses will also need to be allowed for.

- Transition intensities will be applied to each state to determine the numbers expected in the various states for the following month.

- The multi-state model can be very complex with hundreds of sub-cohorts requiring assumptions.

- Although the multi-state model is the more technically accurate approach there is unlikely to be sufficient data available to follow this approach and it may lead to spurious accuracy.

- Due to the increased granularity it allows for sensitivity testing which is not as easily achievable using the inception/disabled life annuity approach.

iii. Appropriateness of a multi-state model:

- Since the insurer has been selling income protection products for 15 years it may have a large amount of data available.

- Even if the past data available is granular enough, consideration would need to be given to the appropriateness of this data in terms of changes in the economic conditions, benefit definitions, target market and claim management processes.

- The time and resources required to build the multi-state model from scratch will need to be considered.

- External sources could be consulted for assistance with data and modelling, but this could come at a significant cost.

- Expert judgement may need to be applied where there is a lack of credible data in particular sub-cohorts, which the company may not have.

- To avoid spurious accuracy a more straightforward approach with a reduced number of sub-cohorts is likely to be followed.

- The insurer will need to consider whether the potential for increased accuracy outweighs the risk of insufficient data and time and effort required to build an adequate model.

iv. Possible reasons for losses:

- The claim inception rate is higher than expected.

- The claim termination rates are lower than expected.

- The investment income earned is lower than expected.

- The annuity factors are under-estimating the present value of future claims.

- Selective lapsing being worse than expected and hence having a cohort of lives in worse health on average than expected.

- Higher expenses than expected.

- A downturn in economic conditions and hence a reduced incentive to return to work.

- An increase in fraudulent claims.

- Benefit escalations could be higher than anticipated.

- A change in the claims assessment process which means there is a mismatch between pricing and assessment.

## QUESTION 4

Considerations:

- Avoid anti-selection: ➢ The alteration should be subject to underwriting. For example:

- a declaration of health; and

- a test to prove that the life is not currently smoking.

- Policyholder's reasonable expectations: ➢ Ex-smokers that would now be classified as non-smokers if they applied for a new policy, may reasonably expect to be treated consistently with non-smokers (as per the company's definition).

- Avoid lapse-and-reentry: ➢ The risk is limited because the current pricing basis is used to calculate the premium after the alteration which should lead to a premium consistent with new business premiums. ➢ The lapse-and-reentry risk is further limited, because:

- the policy value before alteration may be positive (which can be viewed as a "single premium" injection); and

- lapsing lives would have to go through the full underwriting process and they will be older, and thus

- premiums on a new policy may not be cheaper.

- Affordability to the insurer: ➢ For this alteration to be affordable, the policy value before alteration should be less than the earned asset share (on average over time). ➢ The excess of the earned asset share over the policy value before alteration calculated on the original premium basis for smokers, represents the accrued historic profit for the period up to the date of alteration. ➢ Since the original pricing basis is used to calculate the policy value before alteration, the expected future profit margins on the existing contract are not extracted from the policy at alteration. ➢ Use of the current premium basis (for non-smokers) to determine the policy value after the alteration will give the expected profit over the remaining life of the contract consistent with new business policies.

- However, the use of select rates is likely to lead to some losses on these policies, which will not have gone through the same level of underwriting as new business policies. ➢ The initial expenses and commission included in the current pricing basis should not be included in the calculation of the policy value after alteration (as they are not payable in the case of an altered policy). ➢ The cost of administering the alteration should be allowed for in the calculation (e.g. by adding this to the policy value after alteration).

- Fairness to policyholders that remain in the smoking pool: ➢ It is likely that this pool would previously have been subject to selective withdrawals as policyholders that stopped smoking could have lapsed-and-reentered. ➢ However, it is still possible that future mortality experience in this pool may be worse than expected under the original pricing basis (as relatively healthy lives leave the pool). ➢ This may ultimately require a premium review (if allowed), which would negatively affect those policyholders, which may be viewed as unfair.

- Fairness to policyholders in the non-smoking pool: ➢ As the company uses the same definition for non-smoker that is used for new business, the mortality experience of this pool is probably not negatively affected.√

- This should avoid premium reviews (if allowed) in future as a result of alterations.

- Fairness to the shareholder / amount of profit extracted: ➢ It could be argued that the shareholders take on the risk of experience being worse than expected in the pool of smokers, which is not compensated. Note to marker: Comments on select rates could receive credit here if not rewarded earlier.

- Boundary conditions: ➢ The company will have to compare the premium after alteration to the premium the policyholder would have paid had they lapsed their current policy and taken out a new one.

- Competitive position: ➢ The company will have to consider how these terms will be perceived by the market which may place the company at a competitive disadvantage for new business if alteration terms are perceived poorly.

- Legislative/professional requirements: ➢ There may be legal and/or professional requirements to treat customers fairly. ➢ It is unlikely that there would be any other restrictions on the terms that can be offered.

- Frequency of change in basis: ➢ To the extent that the new business premium basis does not change frequently, terms offered should be consistent over time.

- Easy to explain: ➢ Equating policy values may be difficult to explain to policyholders, who are unlikely to be familiar with present value calculations.

Very few candidates provided commentary on the likely impact on the various risk pools under this alteration.

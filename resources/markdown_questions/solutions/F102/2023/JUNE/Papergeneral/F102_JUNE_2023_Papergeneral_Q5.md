## QUESTION 5

i. Definitions:

- Appropriation price is the price at which a company will create a unit. ➢ It is the price that maintains the same net asset value per unit before and after the creation of a new unit.

- Expropriation price is the price at which a company will cancel a unit. ➢ It is the price that maintains the same net asset value per unit before and after the cancellation of an existing unit.

ii. Explanation:

- The company is likely to be using the "offer" basis.

- As the business is growing, it implies that there is a net creation of units and a net purchase of assets by the fund.

- The fund will be paying offer prices for its asset purchases,

- hence the use of offer prices for underlying assets in calculating the net asset value per unit.

iii. Assumptions:

- Unit fund growth

- Discount rate

- Expenses (per policy, per premium)

- Expense inflation

- Future decrements: ➢ Mortality ➢ Lapses and surrenders ➢ Paid up

- The minimum guaranteed maturity value will require additional assumptions to be valued (most likely stochastically): ➢ Return distribution for unit fund growth ➢ Discount rate link to unit fund growth

iv. Significant risks:

- Investment risk (returns lower than assumed in the liabilities): ➢ Due to high potential volatility from fund returns (from shares and from currency), there is a high probability of the maturity value biting; ➢ Lower than expected fund returns also leads to lower than expected fund-based charges.

- Lapse risk (early lapses greater than assumed in the liabilities): ➢ Payment of upfront commissions and other initial costs leads to negative asset share in early years and losses for the insurer if lapses are greater than expected. ➢ Lapse experience may be volatile if brokers are motivated more by attractive commission than selling to suitable clients, and lapses may increase significantly if fund returns become unfavourable.

- Expense risk (expenses per policy/premium higher than assumed in the liabilities): ➢ Expenses per policy may be volatile partly due to expenses themselves being volatile and partly due to volatile volume of policies. ➢ If charges are not reviewable, higher-then-expected expenses per policy can lead to large losses for the insurer.

- Expense inflation risk (expense inflation greater than assumed in the liabilities): ➢ Expenses (many of which are fixed and increasing with inflation) may not be well matched to charges (if mostly fund related) and may lead to significant losses over long policy terms. ➢ Inflation volatility may be high in a developing country, and rapidly growing insurer may experience rapid expense growth (e.g. investing in new capability) to support its business growth.

- Operational risk (losses arising from errors, fraud etc) ➢ The magnitude of losses can be very high for the company, depending on the origin of the losses e.g. unit pricing error. ➢ The probability of such losses is not insignificant due to the insurer's circumstances: foreign investments, rapid growth (possibly stretching resources), developing country (which may influence levels of skills available).

- Surrender/Paid-up risk (losses from surrenders exceeding valuation assumptions) ➢ Losses arise if the surrender (or paid-up) charge (if any) is not sufficient to offset loss of future charges. ➢ Fund values may be too small for several years for the surrender charge to fully offset lost future charges. ➢ Probability of surrender may be high if fund returns become unfavourable.

As to be expected, the bookwork parts (i) and (ii) were done reasonably well by most candidates.
The answers to the application parts (iii) and (iv) were disappointing. Some candidates ignored the instructions to give a specific number of responses and gained no credit for giving more than instructed.
For part (iii), a number of candidates provided as assumptions items that are known and therefore not assumptions e.g. policy charges and tax rates.
Answers to part (iv) were disappointing and demonstrated that few candidates understand the risk-based VaR approach for setting capital requirements. Very few candidates seemed to appreciate that the starting point for this method is the valuation basis used to calculate the liabilities, and that capital requirements are based on adverse fluctuations in experience from those assumptions. Some candidates thought that capital requirements are based on fluctuations from pricing assumptions. Many candidates used vague terms such as "poor investment performance" to describe investment risk. Many made the generic statement that assets and liabilities are mismatched by currency, without clarifying this further, and many wasted time writing about how to mitigate risks.

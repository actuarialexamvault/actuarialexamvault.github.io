## QUESTION 6

i. Factors influencing asset mix:
Nature, term and currency of the liabilities

- The liability under a conventional with-profits policy is partly guaranteed in monetary terms (the basic sum assured and reversionary bonus, once declared) and partly discretionary.

- Currency is likely to be local, while term is influenced by the outstanding term of existing policies and new policy terms.

- In terms of the discretionary component the insurer would aim, as far as possible, to invest to provide returns that meet with the reasonable expectations of policyholders (PRE). Policyholder expectations:

- PRE is influenced by the company's past bonus declarations, marketing material and returns on similar products in the market.

- Policyholders who take out a with-profits policy will expect the proceeds to at least maintain their value in real terms. Level of free asses / Insurer risk tolerance:

- The level of freedom that the insurer has will depend on the level of free assets.

Business objectives of the company (including competitive position):

- The insurer may aim for bonuses that compare favourably with competitors especially if it intends continuing selling this product. Appropriate assets:

- Guaranteed benefits are likely to be matched by fixed interest bonds of suitable term.

- Discretionary benefits are likely to be matched by equities and index linked bonds. ➢ The mix will depend on factors listed above e.g. PRE may imply that policyholders have high risk tolerance and expect high bonuses over time, enabling and requiring a higher proportion of equity investment.

- Overall, the high proportion of terminal bonuses will imply a higher proportion of equities. ➢ This is because the insurer has a longer duration over which it can declare the bonuses and hence can invest in riskier but higher expected return yielding assets.

- Some cash would be held as working capital and to meet claims.

ii. Factors to consider:

- Because no new business is added to the book: ➢ Over time there will be fewer generations over which to smooth experience; and ➢ The ability to take corrective action (e.g. to deal with a year with poor investment returns) is reduced.

- In the short term, policyholder reasonable expectations might be for the current split to remain unchanged.

- The company also needs to ensure that the existing surplus, and future surplus arising, is spread equitably over remaining policyholders so that the last few remaining policyholders are not unduly rewarded or penalised.

- In addition, as the book decreases in size: ➢ The mortality surplus is likely to become more volatile. ➢ It becomes harder to maintain a well-diversified portfolio of assets, increasing the volatility of returns,

- Over the longer term it may therefore be necessary for the insurer to: ➢ Reduce the smoothing of the terminal bonus between generations, leading to potentially more volatile terminal bonuses, all else being equal.

- Alternatively, the company may consider: ➢ Changing the investment strategy so that investment returns are less volatile.

➢ This change will allow the company to change the split between reversionary bonus and terminal bonus in favour of greater reversionary.

- Changing the split has the advantage of distributing surplus as it arises, ensuring equity between generations.

- If this change in the bonus distribution strategy is implemented: ➢ It will lead to an increase in guarantees and a (further) reduction in free assets. ➢ It may reduce the capital available to the company for other business plans and. ➢ It may require a special reversionary bonus to distribute accumulated surplus equitably.

- This special reversionary bonus must be carefully communicated to avoid creating policyholder reasonable expectations.

- Any changes (either in the smoothing of terminal bonuses or a change in reversionary bonus) will have to be phased in over time.

- This will allow the company to communicate the changes to: ➢ Manage policyholders' reasonable expectations. ➢ Attempt to manage the risk of an increase in withdrawals.

- Increasing withdrawals would lead to an increase in the per policy expenses.

- Professional guidance (and possibly regulation like TCF) should be considered. Most candidates did reasonably well in part (i) of this question. Some candidates spent too much time on this part and provided too much detail (given the mark allocation and the instruction in the question to focus on the "key" factors). Part (ii) of the question was challenging and most candidates performed poorly. The instruction clearly indicated that the considerations in the context of a "closed book" should be "discussed". Candidates that only listed the bookwork, did not score well.

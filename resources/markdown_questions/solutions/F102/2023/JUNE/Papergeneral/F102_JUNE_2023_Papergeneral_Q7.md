## QUESTION 7

i. Factors to consider:
Clients' needs, marketability and profitability:

- The proposal will provide better value for money for younger clients although young clients may not be inclined to purchase as much cover as older clients even though the price has been reduced.

- The actuary will need to consider whether the business can be presented in a way to appeal to younger clients with a lower premium and now also separately to older clients with a higher premium to determine the product mix and charging to ensure sufficient volumes to cover expenses.

Competition:

- If competitors use age as a rating factor then this change will bring the product more in line with competitors and stop the company from attracting too many older clients.

- The company will need to be competitive relative to the market on all rating factors in order not to continue to attract substandard lives at a cheap price (anti-selection). ➢ And hence improve profitability.

- It is important to note whether most competitors in the market have further rating factors (e.g. gender or socio-economic status), as the age change may not be sufficient if this is the case.

- Competitors' rating, coupled with any upfront medical underwriting will need to be considered. Cross-subsidies:

- Currently, there is a cross-subsidy between older and younger clients, with younger clients likely subsidising older clients.

- It is likely that younger clients may not have bought this product as much in the past as a result. Alternatively, there may be a disproportionately large number of older clients.

- Older clients could be unhappy as they will need to pay more, and younger clients should pay less.

- There may be possible reputational implications if this cross-subsidy has been in place for many years (and due to now potentially charging higher for older clients). Consistency with existing business:

- It is probable that existing clients will not have surrender values.

- Younger clients may lapse products and take out the new solution (Lapse and reentry) if rates are not changed immediately on existing business.

- This would make the losses on the existing book worse.

- However, may only be able to make changes from next renewal. Product risks: (Anti-selection and lapse and re-entry risks addressed in other points.)

- Depending on the changes made, there is a risk of losing some clients, which could impact the cost per policy and spread of overhead expenses.

- This may result in the premium needing to be adjusted upwards for increased charges. Administration and execution:

- The administrative implication of any change to underwriting will also need to be considered, in line with changes in pricing.

- Different prices for different clients will have an impact on administration and IT systems. ➢ These changes will be costly in their own right and these costs will need to be recovered. ➢ Possibly through an increased premium. ➢ This may be time-consuming, delaying the introduction of the age-related premiums.

- The type of age rating will need to be considered and will impact the sales and administration process - e.g. will rating be in age bands or different for each age. Other markets:

- Such a product may be well established in other markets and lessons learnt from those could be used in this country. Other relevant factors, suitably discussed in the context provided, could also gain credit.

ii. Factors used to group data:

- Type of contract (age-rated or non-age-rated).

- Duration in force.

- Size of premium / sum assured.

- Frequency of premium.

- Age.

- Premium payment method. (The original term of the contract is not relevant (as already covered by age), and gender is not known.)

iii. Further analysis:

- The company can verify the data used and make sure that decisions are taken based on accurate information.

- Initial results are for the book as a whole. The company will need to find the contracts where the lapse rates are significantly higher than what was expected.

- Identify the factors contributing the most to lapsed policies e.g. age, duration in force, etc

- In carrying out detailed lapse and surrender studies priority will be given to, for example, lapses where initial underwriting and initiation costs are unlikely to have been recouped.

The following actions could be taken, depending on the potential cause:

- If poor customer service is contributing to the high lapse rates: ➢ Staff training to improve service levels. ➢ Establish a customer service unit/sales force unit (retentions team) to target policies that lapse and try to reinstate them.

- If poor value for money/affordability is a concern: ➢ Introduce changes to the product design to enhance retention - e.g. cash out bonuses or loyalty bonuses to encourage clients to keep the policy. ➢ Reprice or redesign so products compare favourably with competitors. ➢ Target a higher income segment where affordability is less of a concern. ➢ Consider revising the underwriting processes to account for elements such as affordability, etc.

- If it is believed the distribution channel is a problem: ➢ Ensure the sales process leads to appropriate sales to reduce the risk of misselling/improve training. ➢ Identify if there are deficiencies in the sales remuneration structures offered. ➢ The company could also look to change its distribution channels to one that provide tailored advice to clients.

- If clients are lapsing unintentionally by forgetting to pay: ➢ Consider suitable reminder mechanisms or alternative billing mechanisms (e.g. debit orders) to improve retention.

- If policyholders are lapsing due to concerns regarding the company's image/reputation: ➢ Spend on advertising and promotion to improve brand image in the marketplace.

## QUESTION 8

i. The additional morbidity risk:

- The additional premium charged on the base contract to cover the option cost may prove to be inadequate to cover the cost associated with a higher critical illness inception rate than expected.

- TopCI will now need to be able to price separately for each CI. The extent of the morbidity risk will depend on the quality and extent of data available to do this.

- In addition, there are potentially correlations and comorbidities between CIs

- The company may ultimately be exposed to "new" CIs which are not on the current list of 10, but which may be added by the NIB in the future.

- There may be anti-selection at outset, with policyholders not seeking cover for the CIs which they believe they are at least risk of contracting.

- There may be significant anti-selection when additional CIs are added. ➢ In particular, there could be instances where policyholders add coverage for a CI for which they have already being diagnosed as having contracted. ➢ The premium rate charged for the addition of a CI may exacerbate the antiselection if excessive margins have been included.

- The morbidity risk is also likely to increase if the take-up rate of the option is lower than expected, owing to increased variability and anti-selection.

- The anti-selection risk will be exacerbated by selling through independent intermediaries.

- The extent of the additional risk posed by anti-selection will be impacted by the level of initial underwriting carried out. Although it will be the same as for the standard policies (whatever that may be for this company) it may not be sufficient.

- Withdrawals, and hence selective withdrawals (impacting morbidity), may be more of an issue on the new product as policyholders review their cover on the stated option dates at which time they may decide they no longer require the cover.

- Risk pooling will have diminished relative to the standard product, as some CIs may have limited take-up. ON the standard policy all were included.

- Reinsurers may be less willing to provide cover for the morbidity risk, leaving TopCI with more exposure to the morbidity risk.

ii. Possible reasons for disappointing levels of new business:

- The product may appear complex and be too different from the others available in the market to be attractive.

- If it appears complex the independent intermediaries may not wish to sell it.

- The premium rates may not be sufficiently attractive compared to products which cover all 10 CIs from outset.

- If premium rates are not attractive it may not be easy to sell through independent intermediaries.

- Potential policyholders may be concerned about all 10 standard CIs and not just 5 of them.

- The product may be perceived more for what it is not covering than for what it is covering.

- The uncertainty about future premium rates when adding additional CIs could be off-putting.

iii. Ways of mitigating the risk:

- Limit the maximum sum insured available on these contracts to limit exposure.

- Limit the maximum number of CIs which can be added through the options to limit CI exposure.

- Limit the number of option dates to restrict the number of opportunities for antiselection.

- Only allow an option to be exercised on certain life events (e.g. marriage) or if all previous options have been exercised. This will limit the scope for anti-selection.

- Limit the time available during which each option needs to be exercised. The longer it is left open the greater is the chance of something going wrong with the insured's health (increasing anti-selection).

- Restrict the term of the base contracts in order to limit the time period to which the option applies.

- Restrict the option to lives accepted on standard terms or ensure that any exclusions incorporated for the base policy apply to each CI added through the option, as substandard lives pose a higher risk.

- Use waiting periods relating to each additional CI added to reduce anti-selection.

- Introduce a pre-existing exclusion on all option policies effected after the base contract to reduce the risk of anti-selection.

- Increase claims underwriting to eliminate invalid claims. This will be of particular importance if a pre-existing (or other) exclusion is in place.

- Price conservatively initially to ensure sufficient premiums are collected to cover the option risk.

- Encourage take-up of additional CI cover, e.g. through reminder notices, in order to reduce anti-selection at each option date.

- Pricing of the premium to be charged when adding an additional CI should be kept attractive to encourage take-up. Setting unattractively high premiums at that time will exacerbate anti-selection.

Part (ii) was answered reasonably well.
In part (iii) many candidates failed to fully answer the question by not explaining how each of their suggestions would reduce the morbidity risk as required. Some of the suggestions given by candidates altered the core design of the proposed product (which had been explicitly prohibited in the question) and thus gained no credit. Some candidates also mentioned reinsurance despite the question specifically stating "other than reinsurance". Some suggestions made had nothing to do with the morbidity risk.

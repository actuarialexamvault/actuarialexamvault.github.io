## QUESTION 1

i. The cost of the guarantee can be determined as follows:

- The company would project the asset shares of the endowment portfolio, and the level of future bonuses given the company's bonus philosophy.

- The company would also project the accumulated value of premiums at 10% p.a. as the minimum level of benefits guaranteed.

- While the guarantee is based on sum assured and bonuses, market-traded options are based on the price of assets, which in this case could be taken as the level or price of the assets backing the asset shares.

- The cost of the minimum guarantees could be determined using the cost of markettraded put options applied to the projection of asset shares: ➢ The cost of the minimum maturity value could be determined by referencing the cost of European style put options to sell the assets underlying the assets shares at the maturity date, at the required strike price to match the minimum guaranteed benefit. ➢ The cost of the minimum surrender value could be determined by referencing the cost of American style put options to sell the underlying assets at the required price to match the guarantee, at any time during the term of the policy.

ii. Difficulties:

- Given the limited set of stocks and bonds available, there may not be options available for the full range of instruments required.

- The limited markets may lead to liquidity issues for the assets. ➢ This will increase the cost of the relevant option and make the insurance product pricing uncompetitive.

- Given the market limitations, the pricing of options may not yet be accurate. ➢ This may lead to mispricing of the insurance policies.

- There could be difficulty in deciding on the extent to which any margins included in option prices should be reflected in the insurer's pricing.

- Option prices may be volatile or experience short-term anomalies in a developing market. ➢ This may result in the pricing of the insurance contracts being volatile.

iii. Main considerations

- The main considerations for the company would be to understand how the taxation basis of the new country and market works and how this compares to the current country of operation as this could influence various aspects of their strategy.

- This affects both the company tax and tax in the hands of the policyholders.

- Company tax may be levied on: ➢ annual profits; ➢ investment income less expenses in policyholders' funds; or ➢ both of the above.

- Taxation can lead to advantages (or restrictions) during the different stages of the policy. ➢ If premiums are fully or partially deductible from the individual's taxable income, or other tax incentives are offered, it can create a strong selling point for the insurer. Conversely, a premium tax may add an extra cost layer, affecting both pricing strategy and consumer appeal. ➢ Understanding how funds are taxed during the contract's term is crucial and it can impact the investment strategy of the insurer. ➢ The eventual taxation of policy benefits may influence the attractiveness too. If the benefits are subject to heavy taxation, it could deter potential policyholders, while favourable tax treatment could be marketed as a key advantage.

- The taxation basis would also affect pricing.

- Restrictive tax laws might limit innovation and flexibility in contract design. This question was not well answered by most candidates. Many candidates did not know their bookwork on option pricing techniques well enough. Candidates who were able to think through the product cycle and the tax considerations at each stage were able to score well in part (iii).

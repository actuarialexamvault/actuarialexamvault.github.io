- Identify potential partnerships with tech companies to enhance the direct sales model.

- Manage the transition with existing intermediaries to mitigate conflicts or legal challenges. Reputational risk:

- Identify potential reputational risks associated with the change and craft strategies to mitigate them.

- Implement crisis communication plans to respond quickly if issues arise. Long-term strategy alignment:

- Evaluate how the change aligns with long-term business goals and market trends.

- Periodically review the approach to ensure it stays aligned with the evolving business landscape. Impact on existing policyholders:

- Carefully assess the potential effects of the shift on existing policyholders and tailor strategies to ensure a smooth transition.

- Maintain open communication with existing policyholders and offer incentives or assurances to foster retention.

ii. Reasons why selling term assurances would be preferable:

- Term assurance contracts are generally simpler and easier to understand. ➢ This could appeal to a broader customer base than whole life assurance. ➢ A lower risk of misunderstanding leads to a lower risk of mis-selling and reputational damage.

- Term assurances would have lower costs. ➢ There should be lower underwriting costs than with whole life. ➢ Administration expenses should also be lower due, for example, to there being no surrender values. ➢ This aligns well with the direct sales model, where cost reduction is often a primary goal.

- Selling a simple and low-cost term assurance (rather than potentially more complex and costly whole life) can foster transparency and trust, contributing to customer retention.

- Term assurance contracts may present a more predictable risk profile.

- Term assurance can be more easily tailored to specific customer needs, such as young families.

- Term assurance premiums are generally lower, potentially leading to higher sales volumes.

- As the end of the term of cover approaches, there will be opportunities to cross-sell other products to policyholders.

- Term assurance contracts can align well with the direct sales model, where efficiency and streamlined processes are key. ➢ This strategic fit can enhance the overall success of the new distribution strategy. Candidates performed well in part (i). Those that underperformed generally did not cover a broad enough spectrum of considerations. Part (ii) was generally not well answered. Many candidates focussed on generic reasons why a direct sales strategy has benefits and thus did not answer the question, which related to why it would be preferable for the company to sell term assurances rather than whole life assurances using a direct sales approach.

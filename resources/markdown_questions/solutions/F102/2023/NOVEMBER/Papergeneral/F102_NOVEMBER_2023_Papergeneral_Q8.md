## QUESTION 8

i. Why the new legislation might have been introduced:

- Policyholders could previously only access their money on retirement, unemployment or death.

➢ Unless they had other savings or access to social security/social insurance/state provided unemployment they could experience hardship.

- If there was an economic shock, the government may have been faced with significant levels of destitution. ➢ This could lead to political instability.

- Policyholders may have been encouraged to resign from their employment to access their unemployment benefit.

- Paying only a third of the contributions into the AF further ensures that policyholders are not left vulnerable at retirement as two-thirds of the contributions (and funds accumulated prior to implementation date) would have accumulated in the RF and cannot be touched before retirement. Annuitisation issue:

- Being able to access a part of their pension as a lump sum at retirement might also be useful and meet policyholders needs and increases policyholder options at retirement. ➢ As an example, they could use this money to pay off any outstanding debts.

- The government can still promote annuities through beneficial tax treatment. Other:

- The government has most likely introduced the new legislation as it expects it to result in a long-term increase in the level of pensions that people will have for retirement and hence reduce potential burdens on the state.

- International pressure and research could have also indicated that this approach would work better in the long-term.

ii. Possible impact:

- The new legislation will be positive for policyholders if they have more flexibility and can access their funds if they need them. ➢ This may lead to increased demand for this product.

- The transfer of accumulated funds to the RF may result in policyholders losing access to their funds due to unemployment and this may lead to unhappiness directed at the insurer and a loss of trust by policyholders. ➢ However, the impact is limited to those that have not made use of the once-off allowance under the old rules.

- The insurer will need to be able to administer on the new basis. ➢ The admin systems would need to keep track of the contributions to the AF and RF ➢ There may also be tax implications with the change.

- The company would need to amend its charges for the product to ensure that its charges are adequate for the greater complexity of the new product.

- There are significant investment issues: The duration of the RF assets can be expected to be longer than the status quo and the duration of the AF assets shorter. ➢ Given the policyholder investment choice, the range of options provided in each fund would need to be considered in light of duration and liquidity needs.

- Total demand for the insurer's annuity products may drop now that compulsory annuitisation only applies to the RF and not the AF. ➢ But demand for alternative products for older savers may increase E.g. prefunded LTCI policies.

iii. Advantages:

- Introducing the guarantee will make the retirement products more marketable to potential policyholders. ➢ This could potentially meet a real need of customers who might want certainty regarding their retirement income.

- This may help the company to obtain a competitive advantage in the market and the company might gain more market share.

- This may result in more profitability to shareholders, which would be one of the objectives of the company. Disadvantages:

- The guarantee is complex for policyholders who might not understand the benefit. ➢ For example, their needs may change between locking in the rate and taking out the annuity. ➢ Such as gaining or losing a spouse.

- Advisors and sales staff would need to be trained to ensure that they are able to properly assist potential policyholders.

- Managing the investment risk associated with the guarantee will be complex and if not properly managed it will increase the risk of substantial losses and possible insolvency for the insurer. ➢ It could add significant additional capital requirements.

Part (iii) was generally well answered and most candidates answered the question asked and focused on the advantages and disadvantages of the guaranteed annuity option (GAO).
Candidates who performed better took account of the specifics in the question, e.g. "'developing country" potentially meaning it may be difficult to hedge the GAO or price if using option pricing techniques

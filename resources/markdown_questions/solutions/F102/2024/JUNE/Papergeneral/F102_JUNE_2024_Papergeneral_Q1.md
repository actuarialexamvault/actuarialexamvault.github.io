## QUESTION 1

i. Product design differences:

- For tiered benefits to be paid the benefit design will require different levels of severity to be specified.

- Each level of severity will have its own level of cover.

- Each level of severity will require its own claims definition.

- Under the existing product a claim will result in termination of the cover.

- Under the new product a claim will not result in termination of cover, unless a claim is made at the maximum severity for the full sum assured.

- The new product design will need to specify how cover is reduced/reinstated after a partial claim.

- The new product design will need to specify what happens if a mild condition progresses into a more serious one.

- The new product design will need to specify whether there will be any reduction in premium after a partial claim has been made.

- It is likely that the insurer will be liable for a wider range of claims under the new product since policyholders can claim for milder conditions than would be valid under the standard lump-sum product. Therefore, the insurer should consider implementing stricter underwriting requirements for the new benefit.

- The insurer will need to ensure that its salesforce is well equipped to explain the new design to consumers as it is more complex and may lead to policyholder dissatisfaction if they do not fully understand the product. Pricing differences:

- The current product requires an incidence rate per condition by age.

- The new product will require an incidence rate per condition, per severity by age.

- The administration of the new product is likely to be more onerous and therefore may require a higher administration expense assumption.

- There is likely to be more uncertainty in the expected claims experience of this new product, and therefore higher margins may be required in the pricing basis for the new product.

ii. Comments:

- The statement is not necessarily valid as it does not state whether the new product will cover the same conditions as the old product.

- The products may have different exclusions.

- The new product may have additional benefits, such as children's benefits, which the old product did not have.

➢ If relatively high sums assured are offered, then the increase in the expected frequency of claims may result in a more expensive product overall.

- The underwriting, product development costs and administration expenses are likely to be higher for a tiered product than a non-tiered product, leading to higher expense loadings on the office premiums.

- The increased uncertainty in the claims experience of the tiered product may result in higher margins needing to be assumed in the pricing basis.

iii. Claims experience during lockdown:

- Since people will be forced to stay at home, they may miss some of their scheduled doctors' appointments.

- People may be scared to visit medical centres in fear that they may be infected by the pandemic illness.

- Therefore, people may miss their regular health screening appointments such as mammograms or prostate checks.

- This is likely to result in lower than would otherwise have been anticipated critical illness diagnosis rates during the lockdown period.

- This may result in a reduction in critical illness claims for the insurer during this period.

- If the pandemic illness itself is covered then the critical illness experience would be significantly worse. Claims experience after lockdown:

- This may, however, result in an increase in claims in the future as the diagnoses that were "missed" during the lockdown are "caught up" shortly after the lockdown.

- This may also mean that the critical illnesses then diagnosed may be at a worse stage of development than they otherwise would have been.

- The pandemic illness itself may have exacerbated the likelihood and/or severity of covered critical illness conditions.

- This would mean that for the new tiered product the insurer may experience more claims at higher tiers than they otherwise would have expected.

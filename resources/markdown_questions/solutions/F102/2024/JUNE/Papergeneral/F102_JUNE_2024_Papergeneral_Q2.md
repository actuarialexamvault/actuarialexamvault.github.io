## QUESTION 2

i. General principles:

- The company would select assets that maximise returns.

- The company would select investments that minimise risk, by: ➢ Selecting assets that match the liabilities by nature. ➢ Selecting assets that match the liabilities in term. ➢ Selecting assets that match the liabilities by currency.

- The company would aim to maximise returns subject to an acceptable level of risk.

- The company would rely on the extent of its free assets to determine how much risk it could take on.

ii. Impact of legislation:

- Legislation may restrict the company's ability to match its liabilities: ➢ There may be restrictions on the level of assets that may be invested offshore. ➢ There may be restrictions on the level of assets that may be invested in a particular instrument. ➢ There may be restrictions on the level of assets invested in a specific asset class or currency. ➢ There could be a prescription to invest in certain assets. ➢ There may be limits on counterparty or credit risk. ➢ There may be limits on the extent to which a specific asset class may be taken into account to demonstrate solvency. ➢ There may be a minimum credit rating required for bonds. ➢ There may be restrictions on the level of mismatching. ➢ ESG considerations may need to be applied when selecting investments. ➢ Regulation may exist in respect of a minimum liquidity requirement.

iii. Determining a suitable investment strategy:

- The company should model the expected future liabilities under the portfolio of with-profits endowment policies to determine a suitable portfolio of assets.

- Investments should match the modelled liabilities by nature, term and currency: ➢ The guaranteed death and maturity benefits, comprising the sum assured, are liabilities that are guaranteed in money terms.

- These should be matched with government bonds of a matching term.

- In the local currency. ➢ Future expenses are liabilities guaranteed in terms of a non-investment index.

- These should be matched with inflation-linked government bonds of matching terms.

- These should be matched with assets that provide the highest expected returns over the term of the liability.

- Locally-listed equities would be the best match for these liabilities.

- Given that this is an emerging economy, offshore equities could be considered for additional diversification, however this would introduce currency risk. ➢ Immediate liabilities would be matched fully with cash.

- The company would model the expected returns of different portfolios of assets stochastically. ➢ This would be done to determine what combination of assets gave the best returns at an acceptable level of risk of insolvency.

- The company is newly established and therefore its level of free assets is likely to be low. ➢ It should therefore match guaranteed liabilities as closely as possible.

- The company would consider the level of bonuses declared by its competitors, to ensure that its investment strategy could deliver matching returns.

- The company should consider tax when selecting investments as well as any restrictions placed on investment by legislation.

iv. Changes to investment strategy:

- The change would lead to an increase in the level of guaranteed liabilities, once declared.

- Future reversionary bonuses are a discretionary liability, and suitable investments depend on policyholder expectations. ➢ Policyholders are likely to expect future bonuses to provide real returns, which implies real-return assets are needed.

- This would require an increase in the proportion of assets invested in government bonds and a reduction in equity assets.

- A developing economy is less likely to have an extensive bond market.

- This would mean that the company would have to take on additional risk by: ➢ Investing in corporate bonds and increasing credit risk; ➢ Investing in international bonds and increasing currency risk; or ➢ Retaining a high proportion of equity assets and increasing the mismatching risk.

Part (iii) was also reasonably well answered. Several candidates discussed appropriate assets but neglected to cover the modelling - despite the question asking how you would "go about" determining the strategy. Points were often lost for not describing each component of the liabilities but rather suggesting a holistic strategy. Candidates needed to identify that the risk should be minimised for the guaranteed component by matching.

Part (iv) was not as well answered as the earlier parts, although most candidates identified that the guaranteed component would now increase over time.

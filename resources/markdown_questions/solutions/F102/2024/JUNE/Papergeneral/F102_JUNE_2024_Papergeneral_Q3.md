## QUESTION 3

i. a. An internal linked fund:

- Consists of a clearly identifiable set of assets, e.g. equities.

- It is divided into a number of equal units consisting of identical sub-sets of the fund's assets and liabilities.

- This division is notional.

- The insurer is responsible for determining the price of units b. Basic equity principle:

- The basic equity principle of unit pricing for an internal fund states that the interests of unit holders not involved in a unit transaction should be unaffected by that transaction.

- For the holder of a unit the only prices relevant are those at which they buy units in the fund and those at which they redeem units.

- In theory, the movement in price between those two events should only reflect the performance of the assets backing the units and charges deductible under the policy terms.

- Therefore the price of units should not be affected by creation or cancellation of other units. ➢ Otherwise cross-subsidies between unit holders would arise, which would be viewed as unfair.

ii. a. Impact on the fund's NAV:

- Increase in NAV of R5.0m in respect of the value of the property, plus an allowance for transaction costs of R0.5m (as the fund is valued on an offer basis).

- The cash in the bank account will decrease by R2.5m; and liabilities will increase as a result of the R3m loan.

b. Impact on the fund's NAV:

- Reduces NAV by an accrual of R100 000 for the expense (invoiced to the fund).

- However, if there is an existing related accrual for an amount that is different to the R100 000, the fund's NAV will change by the difference between the new accrual and the existing accrual.

c. Impact on the fund's NAV:

- No impact as this is not a cost incurred by the fund.

- Such costs will be included in the expense allocation to the non-unit fund and will therefore be covered by charges on the policy.

d. Impact on the fund's NAV:

- As the tax only applies on capital gains from a future date, no accrual for CGT is immediately required. ➢ Thus there is no immediate impact on the NAV.

- However, market values may change in anticipation of CGT leading to a reduction in the NAV of the fund. e. Impact on the fund's NAV:

- The value of the fund's equity holdings will be reduced by: ➢ the value of shares sold at offer price; and ➢ the allowance for the transaction costs associated with selling the equities.

- The fund's cash holdings will: ➢ increase by the value of shares sold at the bid price received (which may be lower than offer price); ➢ less the transaction costs incurred on selling the equities.

- The net impact on NAV should be a small reduction reflecting the spread between the offer and bid price, if any, on the shares sold and the effect of the associated transaction costs (likely to be negative, but relatively small).

iii. Constraints:

- Actuarial funding will be constrained to the extent that future charges on the product are sufficient to cover future expenses (i.e. non-unit cashflows should remain positive) when projected on a prudent basis.

- There should also be an appropriate unit-related surrender penalty.

- The extent of the funding is limited by the size of the surrender penalty, so that the surrender value is never larger than the funded value of units (to prevent a strain on surrender).

- The unfunded value of units should only be available on contingent events such as death or at maturity.

iv. Comments:

- Under actuarial funding the unfunded value of units is reduced in anticipation of future fund management charges on the current unit fund, only.

- The bid-offer spread applies on the receipt of a premium. ➢ It would be inappropriate to reduce the current unit fund in anticipation of the bid/offer spread that may result from expected future premiums.

- Although it is true that the bid/offer spread is included in the price of the unit, the charge is fixed in monetary terms (it is equivalent to an allocation percentage). ➢ Therefore, even if the current unit-fund could be reduced by the expected receipt of these future monetary amounts, it would expose the company to the risk of a movement in unit prices.

- Thus, although it is true that the fund management charge can be actuarially funded, the bid/offer charge cannot be actuarially funded.

- The bid/offer spread can be included in the calculation of any non-unit reserves. Part (i) was standard bookwork and well-prepared candidates did well. A common mistake in part (i)(b) was to state that the net asset value would not change due to a transaction, when it should be that the net asset value per unit is unchanged. Clearly when units are created/cancelled, the net assets (for the fund as a whole) will change. Answers to part (ii) were reasonable. Candidates that did best understood how the net asset value would be calculated on an offer basis and were then able to outline the impact of the event on the net asset value before and after the event. The question required an explanation, and so no credit was given for any mathematical formula or statements, where the logic behind the formula or statement was not explained. In part (iii) many candidates needed to be more precise with their answers, for example stating that a surrender penalty was required without stating that it needed to be unit-related. Many candidates explained the process of actuarial funding in general and did not outline the necessary conditions for actuarial funding, and therefore did not answer the question asked. Candidates found part (iv) challenging. Most candidates did not appreciate or state that a bid-offer spread only results in a charge on the receipt of a premium and is a monetary cashflow.

## QUESTION 4

i. Components of the embedded value (EV) calculation:

➢ Alternative to reduced asset values, a deduction to EV can be made for the cost of holding capital requirements.

- The present value of future shareholder profits arising on existing business. ➢ The process of determining this amount is similar to performing a profit test, bearing in mind that some elements will not be applicable (e.g. new business expenses). ➢ Unit-linked business: The present value of future charges (including surrender penalties) less expenses and benefits in excess of the unit fund, plus investment income earned on and the release of any non-unit reserves.

- It is important that the reserves used in the determination of net assets are consistent with those used in the determination of the present value of future profits.

- Tax is allowed for within the calculation as appropriate.

ii. The principles that should be considered in setting the EV basis include:

- The basis for an EV calculation should reflect: ➢ Expected future experience on a best estimate basis. ➢ An appropriate risk margin to allow for the unpredictability of profit emergence for life insurance business. ➢ The need for consistency:

- with previous EV bases;

- between assumptions; and

- with published accounts.

- The EV basis should consider the pricing bases as any differences will immediately lead to EV movements on writing new business different to those implied in the pricing bases.

- The assumptions used to determine the assets and liabilities to be shown in the insurer's published accounts should be consistent with the legislation and accounting principles governing the preparation of those accounts in the country concerned. Matters to be considered include: ➢ Whether a going concern or break-up basis is to be used; ➢ Whether the accounts have to be true and fair; and ➢ Whether assumptions should be best estimate or include margins.

- The embedded value basis should comply with any actuarial professional guidance on embedded values.

iii. Determining best estimate assumptions:
General:

- The general approach will be to use historical experience to derive best estimates of each assumption, and then to adjust for expected future conditions.

Investment returns:

- This will be based on the expected future returns for each of the asset classes.

- Assumed returns for different asset classes should be consistent with one another.

- The returns for each unit fund are then the weighted average expected return based on the particular fund's asset profile. ➢ This would usually be the longer-term mandate or benchmark.

- Separate assumptions for interest income, rental income and capital gains may be required depending on the tax regime. Risk discount rate:

- This will be based on the risk-free rate (yield on government bonds) of appropriate duration.

- There will be an allowance for return for shareholders and to reflect the risk of the business.

- The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is one method that can be used as a guide to the appropriate level of the risk premium to be added to the risk-free rate. Expenses (including commission):

- Use the most recent expense investigation to derive maintenance unit costs and other relevant costs. ➢ That is, acquisition and initial costs are excluded as these relate to new business.

- Expected investment expenses should be considered separately and could be deducted from the assumed investment returns above.

- Commission will be based on the commission scales in place. Expense inflation:

- This could be based on the company's expectations for expense growth,

- Alternatively, it could be taken from the difference between the nominal and real yield curves.

- The assumptions for expense inflation need to be consistent with the assumptions for investment returns. Withdrawals:

- The recent experience would be a starting point.

- However, this assumption is more sensitive to expected future economic conditions including employment rates. Tax:

- Any expected changes to these would normally only be taken into account if the changes were certain and imminent. Mortality and/or morbidity (for products that provide risk cover):

- Use the recent internal mortality or morbidity investigation if sufficiently credible.

- Alternatively, use reinsurer or industry standard tables, adjusted for the demographic profile of the insurer's policyholders and the insurer's underwriting standards. Overall the question was not well answered, indicating a general lack of understanding of embedded values, even though the question was primarily about setting assumptions. Part (i) was bookwork. Most candidates stated the main components but did not give all the details. Candidates struggled with general principles for EV basis setting in part (ii). Answers to part (iii) were disappointing on the whole given the simple nature of the question. Many candidates wrote about matters other than assumption setting, such as explaining the effect or importance of an assumption or describing calculation methods. The question clearly asked for how assumptions could be set, rather than why for example. In parts (ii) and (iii) there was also some confusion between published reporting, which is determined by the market, versus supervisory/prudential reporting, which is determined by the regulator.

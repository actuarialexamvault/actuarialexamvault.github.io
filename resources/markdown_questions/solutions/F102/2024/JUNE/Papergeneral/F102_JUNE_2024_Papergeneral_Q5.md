## QUESTION 5

i. Main features of a passive valuation approach:

- The valuation method is relatively insensitive to changes in market conditions and the basis is updated relatively infrequently.

- Assets are valued on historic cost, with possible amortisation over time.

- Reserves are likely to be calculated using the net premium method.

- Assumptions remain unchanged ("locked in") from those used when the policy was first written. ➢ There may be a requirement to update demographic assumptions if experience worsens.

- Solvency requirements are likely to be determined using a simplified approach such as a prescribed percentage of liabilities.

- It is straightforward to implement and less subjective than an active approach.

ii. Possible types of data errors, and checks to identify them:

- Missing policies. ➢ Check that the number of policies in force reconciles with policy movements.

- Errors in Sums Assured in force. ➢ Check that sums assured in force reconcile with policy movements sums assured.

- Errors in start or end date (and therefore outstanding policy term). ➢ Check against original application forms, or ➢ Check for unusual or unlikely values.

- Errors in policyholder details (e.g. age, gender). ➢ Check against original application forms, or ➢ Check for unusual or unlikely values.

- Errors in policy status (e.g. showing a policy as active but the insured is deceased or the policy has matured, or as single premium when it should be recurring premium). ➢ Check that premiums received are as expected on active policies.

- For regular premium policies where the allowance for expenses is implicit, the office premium will be needed to test the adequacy of this implicit assumption, and there could be errors in the office premium (e.g. captured incorrectly at inception). ➢ Check that office premiums in force reconcile with policy movements office premiums, or ➢ Check the ratio of office premium to sum assured for all business in aggregate over time for unusual changes.

iii. Implications of changing to an active approach:

- Valuation models will need to be redesigned. ➢ Gross premium valuation is more complex requiring more assumptions. ➢ Experience analyses for more items will be needed (e.g. expenses). ➢ Experience analyses will be required more often. ➢ A long lag time may be needed before YouSave is ready to implement the active approach.

- Asset values are based on market prices, or proxies for market prices for illiquid assets, making the valuation more complex than simply using historic values.

- Financial results will be more volatile and more complex to understand and explain.

- Additional costs will be needed for training staff and for IT/modelling.

- Two valuations are likely to be needed for a period - one on a passive approach and one on the new active approach before the change is implemented. ➢ This will increase complexity and cost. ➢ There may be a large one-off change in results switching between approaches.

- YouSave may need to review its products, e.g. possibly removing guarantees and options due to high solvency requirements on the new approach.

- YouSave may review its investment and reinsurance strategies to reduce risk if capital requirements are too high on the new approach. Part (i) was bookwork, yet not well answered by many candidates. Some confused valuation approach with investment strategy. Many candidates thought a passive approach means that valuations themselves are infrequent and many thought that this approach leads to little or smoothed changes to reserves over time (rather than profit emergence). Part (ii) was surprisingly poorly answered by many candidates who struggled to think of possible relevant data errors and follow instructions. Many gave examples not relevant to the valuation of liabilities, or otherwise related to the valuation methodology itself, and many were too vague about errors and checks e.g. listing "inaccurate/missing values" without specifying what values were being referred to, or "spot checks" without elaborating what alternative source(s) may be used to check against. When instructed to provide n items, only the first n items given will be marked. Candidates who provide more than n items are wasting time. In part (iii) many candidates suggested that an active valuation approach requires more regular valuations (as opposed to more regular basis changes) than a passive approach, and several suggested that conventional without-profits benefits include bonuses. Many candidates simply listed features of net- and gross-premium valuation methods and many did not adequately explain their points as required.

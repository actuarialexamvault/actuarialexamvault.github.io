## QUESTION 6

i. Features of reinsurance

- Original terms: ➢ The original premium and claims are shared in the agreed proportion (fixed for quota share business). ➢ The insurer provides the reinsurer with its premium rates so that the reinsurer can assess the appropriateness of the premium rates. ➢ The reinsurer then determines what reinsurance commission it is prepared to pay the insurer to determine the total cost of the reinsurance. ➢ The size of the reinsurance commission will take account of the attractiveness of the business being ceded. ➢ The amount of the sum assured to be reinsured can be on a quota share or individual surplus basis.

➢ The risk premium can be renewed annually or guaranteed depending on the contractual agreement. ➢ The amount of the sum assured or sum at risk to be reinsured can be on a quota share or individual surplus basis.
ii. Most appropriate type of reinsurance and how it works:

- Since the company is looking to manage its exposure to single events, catastrophe reinsurance (or Aggregate Excess of Loss (by event)) would be the most appropriate reinsurance.

- Catastrophe reinsurance is a type of non-proportional reinsurance.

- This would be useful to manage some of the concentration risk that the company would be exposed to by writing group life business (e.g. employees working at the same location).

- The cover is usually only available on an annual basis and must be renegotiated each year.

- Catastrophe reinsurance covers deaths in excess of a certain number. ➢ From a single event ➢ Within a fixed time from the event

- The definition of what constitutes a catastrophe is specified in the reinsurance treaty.

- Usually there is a retention limit (excess point) up till which the insurer will pay any such losses and then the reinsurer pays out above this limit. ➢ The reinsurers liability in respect of a single claim could be subject to a maximum amount and amounts above this would revert to the cedant. ➢ There is usually a maximum cover per life.

- War, epidemics and nuclear disasters are usually excluded.

- Catastrophe reinsurance reduces the potential loss due to non-independence of the risks.

iii. Why Company A is more likely than Company B to purchase catastrophe reinsurance:

- Company B is large and sells a range of individual risk products and hence it likely has a higher risk appetite and benefits from diversification of risks. ➢ Whereas Company A is a small insurer which writes predominately group life business and hence likely has a lower risk appetite and hence higher need for reinsurance.

- Company B sells individual risk products and hence there is likely no individual link between lives insured. ➢ Thus Company B is likely to have lives insured spread by geographical location.

➢ Thus catastrophe reinsurance would provide appropriate mitigation.

- In addition, it may be common practice for groups of employees to travel together for work purposes. ➢ This leads to the risk of multiple deaths from one travel related incident e.g. a plane crash.

- For Company A, there are also likely to be concentrations of insured lives by broader geographical location. ➢ Hence, any disaster in that location where there are many people could impact those lives (e.g. fire in a shopping centre or a stampede in a sports stadium).

- As a result, Company A is more exposed to single events leading to multiple deaths than Company B and hence it is more likely to purchase catastrophe reinsurance. On average, candidates did well on this question. This is to be expected, as it had a significant bookwork component and some fairly standard application. Part (i) was not as well handled as might be expected for a bookwork question. Part (ii) was well answered, with many candidates listing more valid points than were required to get full marks. Part (iii) had a wide spread of marks. Many candidates focused on alternative forms of reinsurance that might be more relevant for Company B, instead of (correctly) focusing on why catastrophe reinsurance is particularly relevant for Company A.

## QUESTION 7

i. Different types of bonuses the company may use:

- Regular reversionary bonuses added throughout the contract term, where the amount of the bonus is calculated in one of three ways: ➢ Simple: % of basic benefit ➢ Compound: % of basic benefit and already declared bonuses ➢ Super-compound: expressed as two percentages, one applied to basic benefit and one applied to already declared bonuses.

- Special reversionary bonuses, added as a one-off.

- Terminal bonus paid when the contract reaches maturity or possibly also on death or surrender.

ii. Reasons for lower bonus rates:

- It is important to note that the fund cannot distribute more than its average earnings. To the extent that there are undistributed profits, this will provide the company with a mechanism to smooth bonuses.

➢ Return is influenced by the assets held; There could have been a negative change in the economic conditions, makeup of assets or change to the mix of asset classes, or a change in or underperformance by the asset manager(s) and hence lower bonus is being declared to ensure the ongoing solvency of the fund. ➢ The company may also be concerned about poor returns into the future which would impact on the financial soundness of the fund as well as the ability to pay bonuses.

- Mortality surplus could have reduced, which may have been due to: ➢ There could have been adverse mortality experience over the period, which would have resulted in a reduction in mortality profits to declare. ➢ The company may also be concerned about future mortality experience and hence is not able to declare as much mortality bonus as it has previously.

- Reversionary bonuses may have reduced due to the company targeting higher future terminal bonuses.

- An increase in surrenders selecting against the company may have decreased both mortality and investment surplus.

iii. Possible actions:

- Bonus strategy: ➢ Bonus strategy may be changed so as to declare returns more through terminal bonus than recurring bonus: ➢ This will better cater for fluctuations in investment returns/ ➢ It will give more investment freedom and thus potentially increase investment returns through:

- More stable and sustainable recurring bonuses; and

- Higher terminal bonuses.

- This better meets PRE.

- Communication: ➢ Bonuses should be distributed in line with policyholders' reasonable expectations (PRE). ➢ Reasons that experience differs from PRE, or a change in philosophy that may result in a changed PRE should be communicated. ➢ If policyholders understand why bonuses are lower and this is in line with what was communicated in the documentation, it might alleviate some pressure.

➢ If the policyholder expects more than the real rate of return, greater properties and equities exposure may be sought. This will cause volatility in returns, which will need to be communicated or otherwise managed. ➢ This type of investment strategy aligns well where there are lower reversionary bonuses and higher terminal or special bonuses.

- Reinsurance: ➢ The company could consider entering into a reinsurance arrangement to mitigate the effect of poor mortality experience. ➢ Whilst this may come at a cost, it should smooth the mortality experience and hence the insurer could declare smoother mortality bonuses over-time.

- Competition: ➢ Ensure that the fund takes cognisance of what competitors are offering. ➢ Competitor funds outperforming similar funds from the company may cause or exacerbate dissatisfaction.

- Optimisation: ➢ Grow the fund or the assets under management to benefit from economies of scale. ➢ This could relatively reduce the investment expenses and provide better return for policyholders. Part (i), which was bookwork, was well answered by the majority of candidates Part (ii) was generally well answered. However, a number of candidates provided generic answers for lower bonuses and did not link their answers to the question and compare previous to current periods. Part (iii) was generally poorly answered. Candidates did not generate nearly enough points and often did not address the question of alleviating future pressure from policyholders.

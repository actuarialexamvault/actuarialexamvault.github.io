## QUESTION 8

i. Reasons:

- Life cover is available for the whole of life and not just for a limited term.

- In addition to funeral cover a further modest sum assured is being provided.

- The insurer will need to allow for the surrender value payments, which its competitors will not need to do.

- The presence of the guaranteed surrender value effectively turns this product into an endowment assurance of unlimited term (and should thus be more expensive than a term assurance of any term).

- The guaranteed surrender value may be taken at any point in time, opening the insurer up to financial anti-selection. This needs to be priced for.

- The insurer's IT/administration systems may be older and less efficient than those of its competitors, resulting in higher costs.

- It may need to improve processes, e.g. employing more staff to improve the speed of claims payments.

- As this is a new product to the market, there may have been significant marketing expenditure, and intermediaries may require higher commissions in order to sell it.

- With the likely low initial new business volumes and the time it may take for the insurer to build up similar volumes to those of competitors, fixed expenses may need to be spread over fewer policies than those of competitors.

- The insurer has no experience in this market and so may need larger margins in its pricing assumptions (e.g. expenses, volume and mix of new business) than needed by competitors with some experience.

ii. a. Mortality risk:

- The risk faced is that mortality experience is worse than allowed for when pricing (and so claims occur sooner than anticipated).

- The risk is exacerbated due to the insurer not having any mortality data applicable to the low-income sector.

- The limited underwriting also exacerbates this risk.

- With low initial business volumes there will be a risk of random fluctuations in mortality experience.

- The mortality risk will reduce over time as the insurer builds experience and a base of mortality data in this market.

- It may be possible to mitigate this somewhat by obtaining some pricing/data assistance from a reinsurer.

- The low-income target market is likely to have worse average mortality than the insurer's current business, but it is the higher likely variability of that mortality which poses a risk.

- There is also a risk that withdrawals may be selective, leaving the company with a worse mortality experience than expected. b. Expense risk:

- The risk is that the expenses are higher than anticipated and loaded for in premiums.

- As this is without-profits business there is no opportunity to increase premiums/charges at a later date to cover expenses.

- The company is also exposed to the risk of inflation being higher than expected on the administration and overhead expenses over the term of the policies: ➢ The risk will be higher than for competitors due to the whole of life nature of the product compared to term assurance. ➢ The extent of this risk will depend on how closely matched investment growth is to expense inflation.

- The level of expenses will be uncertain because the office is launching a new product (admin. costs, development costs, marketing campaign costs). ➢ The insurer may need to significantly speed up claims processing relative to its standard business, due to the greater financial need of those in the low-income sector. ➢ There may be other unanticipated costs in dealing with this market.

- Changes in the mix of business from that anticipated is also a problem as there are likely to be cross-subsidies involved in the expense recoupment (between policies with larger & smaller sums insured.

- Lower than expected new business volumes, which is a significant risk with this new product unfamiliar to the market, may mean fixed expenses may not be adequately recouped.

- Higher than expected new business volumes may put pressure on administration systems and result in higher new business strain than expected.

- More withdrawals than expected may result in overhead expenses not being covered.

c. Withdrawal risk:

- There is a risk of higher withdrawals than expected at early durations, before initial expenses have been recouped. ➢ i.e. Withdrawals where the guaranteed surrender value is greater than the earned asset share at the time of withdrawal.

- Withdrawal rates are likely to be more unpredictable (and higher) than with the insurer's current business as the low-income market is likely to be less capable of predicting needs and have less stable incomes.

- There may be financial selection against the company at withdrawal based on the guaranteed surrender values and market conditions. In part (i) candidates often compared the premiums against those for BigLife's other products rather than those of competitors as asked for. Several candidates did not restrict their comments to product features or expenses as directed. Some misinterpreted the benefits, thinking that multiple lives were being insured. It was disappointing to see that some candidates tried to give more than the requested 8 reasons

In general, across several questions, examiners noted that some candidate's command of English came across as being very poor. Candidates for whom English is not their first language should give this matter some attention, as it is essential to be able to communicate one's points clearly and unambiguously.

## QUESTION 1

i. Differences:

- Term assurance product (through the internet): ➢ The target market is any person who has a specific need that can be met by a term assurance product. ➢ Term assurance products are typically used for a specific purpose, such as paying off a loan ➢ Since the product is sold through the internet, there is likely to be limited underwriting. ➢ The sum assured will also likely be capped. ➢ It therefore makes the product suited for the lower- and middle-income households, who might not have need for high sums assured. ➢ Because of the limited underwriting, the product might be slightly cheaper (compared to the fully underwritten version), which therefore makes it more suitable for a target market that does not have a significant amount of disposable income.

- Income Protection (independent intermediaries): ➢ People that make use of brokers, may have a higher level of financial sophistication than people who make use of direct underwriting methods. ➢ This product is likely targeted at the middle to upper income classes. ➢ The products sold through independent intermediaries also tend to be more expensive (the intermediary needs to be paid) and there is normally more rigorous underwriting involved. ➢ Income protection products tend to have more complicated definitions and nuances compared to a simple term assurance product and therefore require a higher level of financial understanding (this is where the intermediary assists). ➢ This product is therefore suitable for a target market that has more disposable income and higher financial literacy (or access to an intermediary who can assist).

ii. Product Design Factors:

- Meeting customers' needs: ➢ Both products need to meet the customer needs of their respective target markets. (If not, the company will battle to sell policies and not recoup the expenses invested in designing the products.)

- Profitability: ➢ Both products will have to meet specific profit criteria. ➢ The new income protection product might have a higher profitability requirement if the company is taking on more risk with this product. This will have to be agreed by the company's Board and pricing team.

- Competitiveness: ➢ The products need to be competitive in their respective markets. The income protection product will be subject to more scrutiny. Independent intermediaries are expected to find the best value for money for their clients. ➢ The level of competitiveness will also be dependent on the market and what other competitors are offering. It might be that the competition for term assurance is low and for income protection products the competition is high. The company will have to do proper research for the new product.

- Financing requirements: ➢ The new product might have more upfront costs than the existing term assurance. This will be driven by higher underwriting costs as well as remuneration for the financial advisors. ➢ The new product will likely result in more new business strain than the existing product. ➢ It is therefore important to consider the company's free asset position as well as the impact of writing new business for the new product.

- Risk Characteristics: ➢ The new product introduces new risks related to disability. ➢ The target markets (and products) are also completely different, so the company may also experience different lapse rates. ➢ The company will need to consider what level of risk it is comfortable with for the new product, given that it has little experience in managing the new risks. ➢ The company may consider a reinsurer to help manage the new risks.

- Onerousness of any guarantees: ➢ The company should consider the impact of any guarantees offered on the products. The question did not state any guarantees (like premium guarantees), and it is therefore likely that the company is not offering any guarantees on these products.

- Sensitivity of profit: ➢ The company would have sensitivity tested the term assurance product to mortality, lapses and expenses under various scenarios. ➢ The company will have to do sensitivity tests for the new product as well. This will include morbidity, lapses and expenses. ➢ The company will need to determine if the new product remains profitable and feasible under various circumstances. ➢ Income protection generally has a wider range of outcomes as disability rates vary more with economic circumstances than mortality.

- Extent of cross-subsidies: ➢ The company will determine whether there will be any cross-subsidies for the new product - large policies cross-subsidising small policies. ➢ The company may consider the existing approach on the term product. ➢ It is important that the different products don't cross-subsidise each other. ➢ However, the company may have some economies of scale by adding more policies on its books and these should be spread appropriately across the different products.

➢ The company would need to build a new system with added capacity to manage the new product. ➢ However, the company can leverage their existing knowledge to help with ensuring that the new system is adequate and fit for purpose.

- Consistency with other products: ➢ These products are quite different, so it would be difficult to compare them for consistency.

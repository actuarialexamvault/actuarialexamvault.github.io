## QUESTION 2

Considerations:

- Affordability: ➢ The company should assess whether the alteration is supportable by the asset share (i.e. the policy value before the alteration does not exceed the asset share on average, over time). ➢ The difference between the asset share and the policy value before alteration on the current premium basis, represents the accumulated value of historical profit to the date of alteration. ➢ This could be argued to be an appropriate amount of profit for the risk the company has been exposed to, to date. ➢ The policy value after alteration is calculated using the current premium basis, which means that the future profits expected from the altered policy is consistent with profit expected on the new without-profits policies with the critical illness (CI) accelerator. ➢ The actuary should also consider whether the allowance for initial expenses in the current pricing basis is appropriate:

- The allowance for underwriting costs in the current pricing basis will still be relevant.

- However, other initial expenses that are incurred on new business may not be appropriate. ➢ As the altered policy will lead to a premium increase,

- The cost of additional commission payable should also be included. ➢ The cost of the alteration should be included, for example by adding it to the policy value after the alteration.

- There is a risk of anti-selection from existing policyholders. ➢ Additional underwriting is therefore required. ➢ An exclusion for pre-existing conditions would be required. ➢ It is likely that this option is only available to policyholders younger than a certain age (e.g. 60).

- Offering this option would assist in avoiding the potential problem of lapse and re-entry. ➢ As the policy value after alteration is calculated on the current premium basis, the premium on the altered policy should be consistent with the premium on new policies.

- Surrendering the existing policy and buying a new policy is a boundary condition. ➢ There is still a lapse-and-re-entry risk if the surrender value offered on the whole life policy is very generous.

- The company should consider whether surrender values before and after the alteration are consistent.

➢ Could also only offer as a "once-off", which would limit the problem.

- The company will have to consider alteration terms used by competitors. ➢ This may affect policyholders' reasonable expectations.

- Small alterations. ➢ There is likely to be a minimum sum assured for the CI benefit, so it is not necessary to assess the impact of "small alterations" to the policy.

- Easy to document/administer. ➢ It may be difficult to administer and document because the original pricing basis may no longer be available.

- Easy to explain. ➢ Could be difficult to explain to policyholders, who are unlikely to be familiar with present value calculations.

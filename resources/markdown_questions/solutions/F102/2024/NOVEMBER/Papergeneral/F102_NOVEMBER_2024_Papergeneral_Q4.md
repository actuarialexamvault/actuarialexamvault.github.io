## QUESTION 4

i Market-consistent valuation

- To determine a market-consistent liability value of the without-profits endowment assurance book of business, future unknown parameter values and cashflows are set to be consistent with the market values ➢ where a corresponding market exists.

- Market values are also used for the assets backing these liabilities, if a market price exists.

- One method would be to determine the market price of a portfolio of assets whose cashflows exactly replicate the expected cashflows on the endowment assurance.

- The current market price of this replicating portfolio would then be taken as the market-consistent value of the liabilities.

- It may be difficult to determine a portfolio of assets which exactly replicate the expected cashflows of the endowment assurance.

- An alternative method would be to discount the expected liability cashflows ➢ at current risk-free rates of interest.

- Future investment returns are based on a risk-free rate of return, ➢ irrespective of the type of asset actually held, and the discount rates are also based on risk-free rates.

- The risk-free rates may be determined based on government bond yields ➢ or on swap rates.

- It would be most appropriate to use different discount rates for different durations to reflect a yield curve.

- It would only be appropriate to use swap rates if there is a sufficiently deep and liquid swap market in the country where the insurer operates.

- It may be appropriate to make a deduction to allow for credit risk.

- It is unlikely to be appropriate to add an illiquidity premium to the risk-free rate, ➢ as the insurer would be exposed to price volatility on the bonds backing the liabilities if the insurer has to sell the bonds to pay surrender values during the term of the endowment assurance.

- It may be difficult to obtain market-consistent assumptions for some elements of the basis, such as mortality, persistency or expenses, ➢ for which there is not a sufficiently deep and liquid market in which to trade or hedge such risks.

- For these assumptions the insurer will start with best estimate assumptions. ➢ A risk margin would then be added to the best estimate liability.

- The risk margin would reflect the compensation required by the market in return for taking on the uncertain aspects of the liability cashflows.

- The risk margin can be allowed for by adding an explicit margin to each assumption.

- The insurer may be able to invest in corporate bonds to maturity which exactly replicate the some of the expected cashflows on the book of immediate annuities.

- The insurer would therefore not be exposed to the liquidity risk due to price volatility on the bonds, as the bonds will be held to maturity.

- Corporate bonds typically have a higher yield than risk-free bonds due to the relative illiquidity of these assets.

- It may therefore be possible for the insurer to take credit for the illiquidity premium on the corporate bond yields and thereby discount liabilities at a higher yield than risk-free.

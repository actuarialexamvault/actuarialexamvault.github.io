## QUESTION 5

i. Revalorisation method features:

- The profit, or surplus, to be awarded to a particular contract is expressed as a percentage (r% say) of that contract's supervisory reserve. ➢ The benefit (sum insured) under the contract and the premium payable by the policyholder are then increased by the same percentage (r%). ➢ In practice the premium might remain level (and the benefit increases by less than r%).

- The profit is normally divided into a "savings" profit and an "insurance" profit. ➢ The "savings" profit represents the profit from the assets and can be distributed in whole or in part under the revalorisation method. ➢ The minimum proportion of savings profit distributed is normally specified in policy conditions and is an important marketing and competitive aspect of the product. ➢ The "insurance" profit is that arising from all sources other than return on the assets and is normally retained for the shareholders as reward for pure insurance risks borne.

ii. Reasons for choosing this method:

- The method codifies exactly how a company should distribute its profits - it usually requires very little judgement compared to the additions to benefits method. ➢ This makes the method simple to apply, and ➢ cheaper to administer.

- Some policyholders may prefer this approach: ➢ It may be more understandable and thus appealing to policyholders; ➢ Bonuses are more stable and predictable under this approach as it discourages equity investment - it appeals to more risk averse policyholders (e.g. older policyholders).

- The company may wish to differentiate itself from competitors.

iii. Investment risk:

- The initial sum assured is a guaranteed benefit - if the insurer earns a lower investment return than that required to meet this guarantee (i.e. the assumption in pricing), the insurer will experience a financial loss (all else being equal).

- The company may struggle to find sufficient and adequate assets to match its guarantees and bonus expectations in a developing country.

- The company could face default risk (higher in developing countries) on some of its assets.

- This method is not compatible with profit deferral and equity investment: ➢ Investment returns (and bonuses) may be disappointing (and not even match inflation) compared to competitors who can include equity investments under additions to benefits, causing higher withdrawal risk and reputational damage.

iv. Suitability of the asset split:

- A large part of the liabilities will relate to guaranteed benefits (sum insured) and this must be matched as closely as possible: ➢ By term, currency (local), and nature (fixed). ➢ Local FI government bonds of suitable terms should offer a good match for these liabilities.

- For future bonuses the insurer needs to be certain that it can earn a return that exceeds its valuation interest rate in each period for it to be able to declare bonuses

- FI bonds are suitable for providing this certainty.

- Some liabilities will relate to the insurer's own expenses in administering this business, and these will be real in nature as they mainly relate to staff and IT costs: ➢ Ideally real assets should be used to match these liabilities; ➢ To the extent that these liabilities are small and inflation is not expected to differ much from implied levels priced into bonds, the insurer could invest in FI bonds and cash as it has done, although ILB would be better (if available).

- Cash holdings may be needed to meet claims and expense outgo expected in the short term.

- Overall the asset split does not appear to be unreasonable, provided it is aligned with policyholder expectations and pricing basis.

v. Comments on the suggestion:

- The merit of the suggestion will depend on the reason for it, for example: ➢ To the extent that the insurer has large free reserves and large risk appetite, it could decide to adopt a mismatched position (to pursue higher returns for shareholders and policyholders). ➢ The equity holdings may be suitable for matching the insurer's expenses in administering this business.

Examiner Comments Question 5 was generally not well answered.
Part (i) required candidates to distinguish between the savings profit and insurance profit given their different treatment.
For part (ii) some candidates confused the question and instead wrote about why the insurer should have chosen the additions to benefit method.
For parts (iii)-(v) the candidates that did well were those that generated more points specific to the circumstances (product, developing country etc.) whilst candidates who performed less well made very generic points and did not discuss the situations when equity investment would/would not be appropriate.

## QUESTION 7

i Why use a cash flow approach:

- The cashflow approach will allow for the complexity of the product, e.g.: ➢ multiple lives insured; ➢ multiple projected decrements (death and withdrawal).

- In particular it will also allow the company to investigate the sensitivity to profit due to: ➢ mortality variance; ➢ variations in average numbers of children insured; and ➢ children's ages.

- A cashflow approach allows the measurement of the expected return that the providers of capital will receive.

- A cashflow approach will allow for the projection of both statutory reserves and capital requirements.

- A cashflow approach will allow flexibility to model country A and X together or separately. ➢ The cashflow method may be easier to allow for the different mortality in the two countries. ➢ The cashflow method can allow more easily for different lapse rates in the two countries.

- The company may wish to allow for stochastic decrements or decrements that may vary over time. ➢ It is unlikely that stochastic investment returns will be required since this is a protection policy. ➢ However, mortality could be projected stochastically. ➢ Similarly for lapses which will impact per policy expenses.

- A cashflow method allows the modelling of interdependencies between variables ➢ and the link between the variables and economic conditions.

- A cashflow method will allow the company to model projected birth rates since newborns are automatically insured. ➢ It will also allow this to be varied with factors such as the economy if the company wants to model it.

- The risk discount rate can take account of the term structure of interest rates.

- Tax and reinsurance will be easier to allow for. ii Setting model points:

- The data from Country X may not be useful for the model point data and the company may need to use risk factors to determine model points.

- They may approach the government /reinsurer /census bureau in Country A to determine birthrates and family dynamics to estimate the likely spread of the number of children to be covered.

- For mortality the company could use groupings by: ➢ number of children ; ➢ age of children, ➢ sex of children; ➢ policyholder's ages; ➢ region.

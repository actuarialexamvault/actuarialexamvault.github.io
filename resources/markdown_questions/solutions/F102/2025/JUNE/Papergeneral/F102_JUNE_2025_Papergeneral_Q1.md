## QUESTION 1

i. Determining the basis:

- Assumptions will be needed for interest, expenses, expense inflation, mortality and possibly tax.

- Interest: ➢ This will be the most important assumption;

- Particularly at early durations, where a small change in the interest rate assumption will have a significant impact on the policy value. ➢ Assets backing the liabilities are likely to be invested in fixed-interest investments (if available), matching the liabilities by term. ➢ Therefore a weighted average redemption yield may be suitable for a best estimate assumption.

- Expenses: ➢ The company's most recent expense investigation will indicate the best estimate of renewal expenses. ➢ An allowance is also required for:

- renewal commission; and

- the costs associated with surrendering the policy.

- Inflation: ➢ The assumption should be consistent with the investment return assumption. ➢ The real-return on index-linked government bonds might indicate the margin below the full (nominal) interest rate assumption.

- Mortality: ➢ As this is a new product,

- The mortality experience from a similar product sold by the company could be used.

- External sources of mortality could also be considered e.g. industry mortality tables or tables from reinsurers.

- However, adjustments may be required to reflect any differences in underwriting practice, target market etc. ➢ The assumption should reflect the future expected mortality experience of those policyholders that surrender. ➢ This is possibly lighter than the mortality experience of those who do not surrender, as policyholders that are concerned by the disease are unlikely to discontinue their life cover.

- In practice is may be difficult to prove this difference in mortality experience (as the mortality experience of those that surrender is not available to the insurer). ➢ The company could:

- make explicit allowance for lighter mortality; or

ii. General:

- The company will make a retained profit on the policy equal to the difference between the asset share and the surrender value (SV) paid. a. Decrease in long-term interest rates:

- At later durations, when asset shares are positive, a decrease in interest rates is likely to lead to an increase in asset values backing the asset shares (e.g. long-term bonds), a and therefore an increase in the positive asset shares. ➢ It the company's investment strategy includes a significant cash holding, then there will only be a limited effect on the asset shares.

- Assuming that the company can change surrender values in terms of the contract conditions, at these later durations the best estimate assumption for the interest rate will be reduced, leading to an increase in surrender values. ➢ The increase is due to the expected present value of benefits being more sensitive to changes in interest rates (given the longer discounted mean term of these cashflows), than the expected present value of premiums.

- If assets were: ➢ matched to the expected future liability cashflows, there may not be a (material) change in the retained profit on surrender. ➢ not matched, then there may be a profit or loss depending on the relative change in asset share values and surrender values.

- At early durations, the change in the long-term interest rates is unlikely to affect the retained profit. ➢ The SV is not impacted as it is defined in terms of premiums paid. ➢ The "investment return" assumption on negative asset shares can be interpreted as the cost of funding. ➢ If, the cost of funding is unchanged then, the negative asset share will not change. ➢ If, however, it is linked to a reduction in the long-term interest rates then asset shares may become less negative and as a result losses will decrease. b. Increase in mortality experience:

- If there is only an increase in mortality in the medium to longer-term, then there will be no immediate impact on asset shares.

- The company may decide not to change the mortality assumption used in the calculation of policy values, as only those policyholders that are more confident that they will not be exposed to the disease are likely to lapse.

- The lower (or more negative) asset share will mean a decrease in retained profits (or losses) at both early durations (whilst the surrender value is based on a return of premiums); and later durations.

- If the company increases the mortality assumption used to calculate the SVs, this will lead to an increase in surrender values based on the policy value, which will further reduce profits on surrender. The average mark for this question was very low. Part (i) was bookwork and candidates who were well prepared did well. Many candidates did not read the question carefully, and assumed the question asked for the considerations when setting surrender values (which it did not). Although that may have been a frequently asked question in past papers, it was not the question asked here. Answers to part (ii) were generally very poor. The impact of a change in interest rates on (positive) asset shares is discussed in the course material and can therefore be assumed to be bookwork. Many candidates failed to recognise that lower investment returns and higher mortality assumptions both drive up the prospective policy value of whole life products.

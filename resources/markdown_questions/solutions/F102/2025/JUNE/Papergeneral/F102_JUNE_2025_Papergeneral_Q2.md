## QUESTION 2

i. Advantages to applicants:

- The processing of applications will be faster due to limited underwriting and a simpler product. Therefore, decisions could be taken within a few minutes or hours.

- Applicants do not need to undergo medical examinations, making the process less invasive.

- The filling in of applications is simpler and more convenient, with fewer healthrelated questions.

- These products are more accessible to individuals who might be declined for traditional life insurance due to health issues.

ii. Risks to the insurer:

- The underwriting decision is based on less information (and different information to existing policies), so there is an increased risk of premium rates not accurately reflecting the true risk. ➢ For example, if the simplified questions fail to identify, or underestimate, particular risks, there is a chance that the company can be selected against (i.e. rates too low).

- If mortality experience is worse than priced for, the product could be loss-making (and ultimately threaten the solvency position of the insurer).

- Insurers may charge higher premiums to offset the increased risk which could reduce sales (i.e. rates too high).

- Coverage amounts are likely to be lower compared to fully underwritten policies and therefore the target market might be different to its current policyholders, further increasing the risk of inappropriate pricing.

- Risk of misrepresentation: without medical exams, there is a higher risk of applicants misrepresenting their health status, which can lead to claim disputes.

- Reputational risk: if lots of claims are being declined due to non-disclosure then there is a chance of reputational damage for not paying claims.

iii. Possible reasons:

- Random fluctuations (particularly if the book is still small).

- Misrepresentation e.g. smokers declaring themselves as non-smokers.

- Anti-selection worse than anticipated, for example: ➢ if questions not well chosen to indicate relevant risks; or ➢ competitors underwrite more effectively.

- Salesforce could encourage anti-selection to boost sales.

- Business mix may have been different to expected. ➢ This is a problem if the pricing basis had allowed for cross-subsidies.

- Product may have appealed more to a market with worse mortality. ➢ This would make existing data from old product less relevant than expected. Concerns:

- Poor experience results in smaller than anticipated profits or even losses

- Could threaten company solvency and impact shareholders' net worth

- If the product is reinsured, poor experience will lead to the reinsurance premiums increasing, further affecting the bottom line.

iv. Actions by the company could include:

- Carry out a detailed study of experience to date, particularly as it relates to the responses to the underwriting questions.

- Train underwriters to make better decisions based on existing questions. ➢ E.g. reject / offer special terms for some question responses that are currently being accepted on standard rates.

- Update underwriting questions to be more useful: ➢ Ask reinsurers to review underwriting questions. ➢ Apply behavioural economics to ensure questions obtain desired outcomes. ➢ Compare questions with those used by competitors to identify if there are opportunities for anti-selection.

- Review existing policyholders i.e. carry out some post issue sampling to determine if there is any misrepresentation on current policies e.g. smoking status.

- Change product design. ➢ Reduce maximum sums assured to minimize exposure. ➢ Include waiting periods for claims from natural causes.

- Reintroduce limited additional underwriting on the product.

- Stop selling this product. ➢ Alternatively, sell only to specific groups who are expected to be generally healthy e.g. members of running clubs.

- Sales staff and channels. ➢ Upskill sales staff to ensure the sales process reduces the risks of mis-selling and mis-representation. ➢ The company could change its target market or distribution channels. If "experience" is taken as being relative to the pricing basis:

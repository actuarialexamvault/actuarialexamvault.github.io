## QUESTION 3

i. The cost of a mortality option is the value of the excess of the premium that should, in the
light of full underwriting information, have been charged for the additional assurance over the normal premium rate that is charged.
The total expected additional costs of an option depend on the health status of those who choose to exercise the option, and the proportion of lives that choose to exercise the option, namely: (proportion of lives exercising option) × (average health of lives exercising option)
ii. Key factors to consider in pricing the mortality option:

- Future mortality: ➢ The mortality rates of policyholders who take up the option will impact the cost of the option. ➢ Consider the underlying mortality for the group members and any differences between the group and individual lives ➢ Differences are likely as group schemes typically have less stringent underwriting. ➢ Consider how mortality rates may vary between smokers and non-smokers, as identified by the test to be used.

- Anti-selection: ➢ Members in poor health, who are less likely to pass standard underwriting, may be more likely to opt to take out the option. ➢ Healthier members may be less likely to see the need to continue life cover. ➢ Consider the expected mortality differential between those who take up the option and the broader insured population taking out individual policies.

- Take-up rate of the option: ➢ It will be important to consider the take-up rate for the option, as this will impact its cost. ➢ A low take-up rate could exacerbate anti-selection. ➢ The company may wish to encourage take-up from certain groups of low-risk individuals.

- Pricing margins: ➢ The extent of margins, to account for uncertainty in future experience relative to pricing assumptions, should be considered.

- Expenses: ➢ Administrative costs associated with converting group policies to individual policies will need to be considered, ➢ Underwriting costs will also need to be considered. ➢ The ongoing option maintenance costs (monitoring experience etc) will also need to be considered.

- Experience data: ➢ Consider the extent to which past data (if available) from similar options on the insurer's existing business could be used to inform the assumptions, considering the specific demographics and risk profiles of the group scheme.

- Regulation: ➢ Consider any regulatory requirements related to non-discrimination and fairness in pricing. ➢ This may be particularly relevant in relation to smokers versus. non-smokers.

- Competition: ➢ Consider the pricing strategies of competitors offering similar options and ensure that the pricing remains competitive while adequately covering the risks.

- Take into account additional reserves to be held before and after the exercise of the option.

- Extent of risk mitigation: ➢ The extent of risk mitigation, e.g. reinsurance, should be considered when pricing as this impacts the risk faced by the company.

iii. Anti-selection risk:

- Higher-risk individuals (e.g., those with pre-existing health conditions) are more likely to take up the option, knowing they can secure cover without full underwriting. ➢ The impact is likely to be exacerbated if there is a low take-up rate of the option.

- If the definition of a smoker is not clear (or testing inadequate), smokers might be able to effect the individual policy (as a non-smoker).

iv. Mitigation of anti-selection risk:

- Introduce additional underwriting: ➢ E.g. a short medical questionnaire or tele-underwriting. ➢ This would aim to prevent those who should not qualify from obtaining the cover.

- Impose a waiting period before the option can be exercised. ➢ This should remove the worst cases of anti-selection.

- Restrict eligibility for the option: ➢ Limit to groups likely to be in better health. ➢ E.g. those below a certain age. ➢ Exclude certain conditions such as cancer or diabetes - although this could affect the marketability of the option. ➢ Require those taking up the option to be actively at work - not resigned due to ill-health.

- Increase the price of the option - paid through the group life scheme - to account for the anti-selection risk.

- Apply a free cover limit - if sum assured is above this, then underwriting should be required for the extra cover.

- Monitor the claims experience of those taking up the option. ➢ Adjust future pricing or eligibility criteria based on observed experience.

- Clearly define the definition of smoking, e.g. if you smoked at all during the past 24 months.

- Market the option to policyholders who are expected to be healthiest. ➢ E.g. those below a certain age. ➢ Offering the option digitally only could also achieve this. ➢ However, consider TCF in doing so. Overall the question was reasonably answered. However, few candidates made enough points in all parts of the question. In part (i) many candidates were confused between the option price (option premium) and the cost of an option. In part (ii) some candidates spent a lot of time listing all generic factors to consider when pricing contracts without making answers applicable to the information given in the question. In part (iii) many candidates, unrealistically, said people will join the employer with the plan to leave soon afterwards to be able to take up the option. Candidates also focused on potential over-insurance, which is a different issue than anti-selection. Many candidates said that people could stop smoking before leaving the scheme and take up smoking again after the option was taken up. This is non-disclosure/fraud, not anti-selection. Part (iv) was generally well answered when candidates made their answers applicable to the question. Some made impractical suggestions such as continuously monitoring smoker status in the group scheme or after taking up the option.

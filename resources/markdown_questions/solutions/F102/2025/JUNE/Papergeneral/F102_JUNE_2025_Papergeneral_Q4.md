## QUESTION 4

i. Policyholders' needs:

- The deferred annuity provides a monthly savings mechanism.

- The annuity provides a guaranteed income stream after the deferred period, ensuring financial stability during retirement. ➢ Also, it does not require decisions or management of funds during retirement.

- The annuity helps policyholders manage the longevity risk of outliving their savings by providing lifetime payments.

- Policyholders are protected from market volatility and investment risks, as the insurer bears the investment risk associated with generating the returns required to meet annuity payments.

- If the annuity increases once in payment it should help offset the effects of inflation.

- Annuities can be structured to provide for beneficiaries (for example in the case of joint life annuities), ensuring that dependents are protected if the policyholder dies.

- Should the annuity provide a death benefit (for example a return of premiums paid to date) during the deferred period, beneficiaries would receive additional protection. Company's needs:

- Deferred annuities provide a predictable and steady stream of premium income during the deferred period, improving the company's cash flow and financial planning.

- Offering this product may allow the company to differentiate its products from those of competitors ➢ This could lead to increased new business.

- By offering annuities the company is able to reduce/diversify their risk exposure to mortality. ➢ This is because it creates a hedge between longevity and mortality risk with mortality risk emanating from its assurance book (if they have a material one).

- Providing flexible benefits, such as the impaired life annuity, helps retain customers by meeting their evolving needs, reducing policy lapses and surrenders.

- By accurately pricing the annuities and managing the associated risks, the company can achieve profitability while providing valuable services to policyholders.

- The impaired life annuity option encourages the company to develop robust data collection and analytics capabilities, improving overall underwriting and pricing strategies.

ii. Key risks:

- Insufficient data: ➢ The company may not have sufficient data on future mortality, take-up rate, expenses, etc. to predict future experience. ➢ This will impact the suitability of the level of enhancement offered, and ability to price for it. ➢ Mitigation: Discuss with a reinsurer. ➢ Mitigation: Consider market rates for impaired life annuities.

- Experience is different to that assumed when setting the level of enhancement. ➢ This could result in losses for the company. ➢ Mitigation: Build in margins and carry out extensive modelling.

➢ Mitigation: Implement stringent underwriting criteria on conversion to the annuity ➢ Mitigation: Ongoing monitoring of the mortality of the enhanced annuity experience with updates to reserving, pricing and underwriting, if required.

- Uncertainty in mortality rates: ➢ Predicting future mortality rates for impaired lives is challenging due to variability in health conditions and medical advancements. ➢ Incorrect assumptions can lead to significant errors in setting suitable annuity enhancements. ➢ Mitigation: Use a range of scenarios in mortality assumptions and update them regularly based on the latest medical research and industry trends ensuring that the pricing basis is regularly updated. ➢ Mitigation: Employ stress testing to understand the impact of various mortality assumptions on profitability.

- Uncertainty of the take-up rate of the impaired life annuity: ➢ Uncertainty around how many policyholders will qualify for the impaired life annuity can affect the accuracy of experience modelling. The actual uptake rate may differ from initial estimates, impacting the financial projections and expenses incurred. ➢ Mitigation: Underwrite strictly starting with lower cost options before requiring expensive medical procedures. ➢ Mitigation: Analyse historical data and industry trends to estimate likely takeup rates. ➢ Mitigation: Implement flexible models that can adjust assumptions based on emerging experience and policyholder behaviour.

- Impact of medical advances: ➢ Future medical advancements could significantly alter mortality rates, especially for impaired lives, making it difficult to model future experience accurately. ➢ New treatments and healthcare improvements can extend the life expectancy of impaired lives. ➢ Mitigation: Maintain a robust monitoring system for medical advancements and incorporate a margin for adverse deviations to account for unexpected changes. ➢ Mitigation: Regularly review and update the mortality assumptions (for both reserving and pricing) to reflect the latest medical developments.

- Sales of the product lower than expected: ➢ The product may appear complex. ➢ This complexity may be experienced by the distribution channel as well as potential policyholders. ➢ Mitigation: Provide clear product literature. In general this question was poorly answered, with few candidates performing consistently well in both question parts. Part (i) was generally reasonably answered, although many candidates gave a list of things that could be done by the policyholder with the income, which did not receive marks. Very few candidates mentioned the variations, such as increasing or joint life annuities. In part (ii) few candidates considered the limited data and potential changes to future mortality experience and explored this sufficiently. Many candidates produced a generic prepared "risk list" without considering the key risks at all which did not score well. Candidates who gave a mitigation for each risk, rather than a list of risks and a separate list of mitigations, generally produced better answers.

## QUESTION 5

i Features of the model:

- The model will show projections of future cashflows arising on this portfolio of business. ➢ The key cashflows will be premiums, disability income payments and expenses (admin and ongoing disability assessment). ➢ Reinsurance cash flows (premiums and recoveries) should also be catered for.

- The model must consider two distinct phases, being active premium-paying policyholders who face a future risk of claim inception, and a claim-in-payment liability for policyholders who have already become disabled.

- The projections will need to take into account lapses, mortality, claim inception and recovery rates. ➢ A multi-state modelling approach, with transition probabilities for movements between states, could be used for the projections.

- The projected cashflows must be discounted at an appropriate discount rate that reflects the characteristics of the liability cash flows.

- The projections may be performed on individual policy data; however, since the portfolio is large and we may only be looking for an approximate number, the company may instead decide to use data grouped into model points.

- The same consideration applies to the choice of projection period frequency, e.g. whether to use monthly or annual cashflows.

- An alternative approach would be for the company to use a stochastic model, introducing variability into any or all of the investment return, inflation, mortality or claim inception/rehabilitation/termination assumptions. ii Determining assumptions:

- Assumptions will be required for active lives (lapses, mortality, and claim inception), and disabled lives (claim termination including death and recovery / return to work), expenses, inflation (for premium, benefit, and expense inflation) and risk-free discount rates (since this is a market consistent valuation).

- Generally, assumptions would be expected to be best estimate rather than prudent. ➢ Specific allowances for risk may however be appropriate to reflect uncertainty in the cashflows to the extent that if these liabilities or cashflows were to be traded in an open market then potential purchasers might require a margin to reflect the risk that lapse, mortality, rehabilitation and expense assumptions may prove to be incorrect.

- There is unlikely to be a highly liquid active market for mortality, claim inception, claim termination, or lapse risk, so it may not be possible to determine objective market consistent assumptions for non-economic assumptions. Mortality

- The mortality assumption is likely to be set by reference to industry statistics, internal experience investigations and information from reinsurers. Mortality is likely to be split by age and gender and possibly additional rating categories.

- Mortality might be differentiated between active lives and disabled lives, as the nature of many disabilities may imply higher than standard mortality. Claim inception/rehabilitation/termination

- The claim inception/rehabilitation/termination rates could be based on current experience, information from reinsurers and any expected trends.

- Claim inception rates would likely differ by age, gender and occupation.

- Claim termination rates typically depend on the nature of the disability, age, gender, occupation, and time since claim inception.

- Adjustments are usually made to standard tables as the standard tables can be complex, and not all insurers will have sufficient data to derive complete tables from just their own experience. Lapses

- Lapse assumptions could be based on current and expected future experience. Lapse rates will usually be set by duration in force and possibly policy size or other product characteristics.

Expenses

- The expense assumption might be determined based on the company's own experience and budgeted expenses and expected volumes (allowing for lapses and other decrements but not for new business). ➢ And where available by reference to expense agreements available in the market, for example from third party administration companies, as well as from industry statistics and features specific to the company s own experience.

- Allowance is necessary for medical assessments to confirm continued disability. However, this may not apply to those disabilities that have no chance of recovery. Discount rate

- The appropriate discount rate in order to obtain a market consistent valuation is a risk-free rate. Alternatively returns on index linked gilts may be used for a real risk-free rate. ➢ These yields are likely to vary by term. A yield curve should be used.

- The country in which this company operates is highly developed, which suggests that its government fixed interest bond issues might be close to credit-risk free.

- It might be necessary to make adjustments if there are specific market issues such as supply and demand mismatches, although these adjustments must be made only in very specific circumstances. Expense inflation

- Expense inflation can be estimated by considering market implied break-even inflation the difference between nominal risk-free yields and real (or inflation linked) risk-free yields.

- However, it may be appropriate to adjust these yields if expense inflation is expected to differ from the index inflation.

- The expense inflation assumption must reflect those for a closed book, which may rise faster than inflation due to reducing economies of scale.

- Alternatively, the real expense cashflows could be valued directly by discounting at a real risk-free curve. Tax and investment expenses

thought. Vague references to "morbidity assumptions" doesn't demonstrate appreciation of the actual assumptions needed.
Many candidates confused "valuation rate" or "discount rate" with "risk discount rate". This reflects a lack of understanding of market consistent ideas and misuse of the word "risk discount rate" outside of Traditional Embedded Value or pricing contexts. Several candidates referenced profit testing and profit margins even though the question had nothing to do with pricing.
Several candidates mentioned both investment returns and discount rates without explaining the link between them, or why investment return assumptions are even necessary. Many candidates wrote about asset valuations which was not what was asked for.

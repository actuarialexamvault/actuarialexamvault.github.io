## QUESTION 6

i. Contribution method features:

- Surplus is distributed among policies in the same proportion as those policies contributed to the surplus.

- In practice policyholders will be grouped into relatively homogeneous groups for calculating the surplus (or dividend) payable to them.

- All sources of profit (comprising mortality, expense, withdrawal and investment experience) are usually distributed under the contribution method.

- The proportion of the total surplus which is distributed will vary from year to year. ➢ The amount of distributable surplus will be determined by the company, and the dividend formula will be applied with respect to this surplus.

- The dividend could be paid out as a cash sum, used to reduce future premiums or converted into a "paid-up" addition to the benefit.

- A terminal bonus may be payable.

- There is less subjective judgement required compared to additions to benefits.

ii. Calculation of the dividend in local currency units:
Dividend = (V +P)(i"-i) + (q-q")(SA-V ) + [E(1+i) - E"(1+i")] 0 1 where " denotes actual items of experience Dividend = (50 000+2000)(0.07-0.05) + (0.005-0.01)(100 000-60 000) + [200(1.05)-100(1.07)] i.e. Dividend = 1040 - 200 + 103 = 943 local currency units

iii. Actual dividend may differ due to:

- The dividend may be smoothed to reflect policyholder reasonable expectations and to avoid adverse reaction to low dividends.

- The dividend may be adjusted to be consistent with competitors.

➢ To strengthen financial solvency in order to provide a buffer against future adverse experience and also to enable greater investment freedom for maximising future investment returns and bonuses.

- The dividend formula may exclude items of profit not distributable to policyholders, e.g. some profit margins in the premium or withdrawal experience profit.

- The dividend formula may not accurately reflect timing of cashflows, e.g. the actual timing of premiums, expenses or death payments may differ from that assumed in the dividend formula.

- There may be differences between the sum of individual components of the dividend formula and the corresponding aggregate items, e.g.: ➢ Actual total death claims may differ from the aggregate of SA.q" due to the method used for calculating q" for a small group of policyholders; ➢ Actual total expenses may differ from the aggregate of E" due to the method of determining actual expenses incurred by small groups; ➢ Actual total investment returns may differ from the aggregate of (V +P).i" due 0 to the method of determining actual returns for small groups. Overall performance was disappointing and reflected poor bookwork knowledge. Part (i) was bookwork yet very few candidates scored highly. Part (ii) was a very simple application question and required candidates to know the bookwork formula, which only a few did. Most candidates were able to generate some valid points for part (iii). Almost no-one considered the impact of withdrawal experience as a source of profit.

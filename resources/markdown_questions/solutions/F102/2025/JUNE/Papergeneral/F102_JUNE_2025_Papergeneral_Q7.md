## QUESTION 7

i. Liability characteristics and suitable backing assets:

- The level annuities are fixed in nature. ➢ Suitable assets are therefore fixed-interest or zero coupon bonds, ideally riskfree. ➢ Fixed-interest corporate bonds might be suitable if the company is willing to accept the credit risk for the higher return.

- The inflation-linked annuities are real in nature. ➢ Suitable assets are inflation-linked bonds, ideally risk free. ➢ If inflation linkage for annuities is higher from that available on inflationlinked bonds, or bonds are not available, the insurer might consider real assets such as equities and property. ➢ However, equities and property do not offer guaranteed linkage to inflation and volatile values could increase the insolvency risk for the insurer.

➢ Or, if expense inflation is closer to CPI, then inflation-linked bonds can be used.

- Annuity terms could be very long, requiring bonds of similar duration to be matched (if available).

- Liabilities are likely to be local currency, requiring assets of the same currency to be matched. ➢ If sufficient and appropriate local assets are not available, then foreign assets may be considered along with appropriate currency hedging.

- Short term outgo requires liquid assets and cash is most appropriate.

ii. Reasons for losses and experience items:

- For each of the last two years the insurer may have had one-off losses relating to this particular book, e.g.: ➢ One-off expenses (such as new IT system), or ➢ Counterparty defaults (such as reinsurers, or assets held).

- For each of the last two years the insurer has made adverse method (modelling) and/or basis (assumption) changes to its valuation for this book.

- There may be errors in the underlying data used for either the assumption setting or the valuation and AOS,

- There may have been errors in any of the steps or methods in performing the experience investigations, the valuation or the AoS.

- The best estimate basis could have been inaccurate for other reasons (such as poor judgement).

- Investment losses will arise if the book is mismatched and the market moves against the insurer, eg: ➢ Mismatched by duration; or currency if holding foreign assets without currency hedges; or credit spreads moved against the insurer if holding corporate bonds.

- For existing business profits/losses arise due to differences between actual experience and the valuation basis (i.e. best estimate), similar to above.

- If the level annuity book is small it is likely that experience could be more volatile than for a larger annuity book. That is, the losses are just random fluctuations (particularly if small losses). Most candidates did very well on part (i). The answers to part (ii) were generally poor and most candidates struggled to give appropriate answers or a sufficient variety of answers. Some answers were too generic and not tailored to the specific situation. Very few candidates appreciated that investment losses arise only where there is a mismatched position and the market moves against the insurer. A large number referred to withdrawals or similar, which is not possible for standard annuities in payment like these. A significant number referred to new business strain as if this was automatic. However, this only arises for single premium business if the pricing basis is more aggressive than the valuation basis.

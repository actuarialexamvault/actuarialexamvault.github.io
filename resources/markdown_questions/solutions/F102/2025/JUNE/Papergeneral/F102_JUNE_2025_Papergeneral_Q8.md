## QUESTION 8

i. Advantages for the policyholder:

- Benefits are available on death/surrender/maturity. ➢ Although these are not expected to be significant, they would not be available at all on conventional policies.

- Pricing should be more competitive than with conventional business. ➢ Fewer margins need to be included when pricing due to the fact that risk charges and premiums are not guaranteed.

- If the insurer's morbidity experience is better than expected charges should be reduced. ➢ This would result in higher unit-related benefits than expected (i.e. death, surrender and maturity benefits). ➢ Alternatively, premiums may be reduced at policy reviews.

- There could be some flexibility to vary premium or benefit levels under in-force policies. ➢ This could include increasing the risk benefit (subject to underwriting).

- The product could easily be changed by including elements to meet other needs. ➢ E.g. by adding an increased guaranteed minimum death benefit. Disadvantages for the policyholder:

- Investments may perform worse than anticipated (in the only unit fund offered). ➢ This would result in lower death, surrender and maturity benefits than expected.

- If policyholders wanted to increase their risk benefit in the future the unit-linked structure could deal with this, but the additional cover would need to be underwritten, and so there is no guarantee it would be available on suitable terms (if at all) dependent on the policyholder's state of health. .

- The contract may be difficult for policyholders to understand. ➢ E.g. the variability of charges, or why certain benefits are unit-linked and not others.

- Similar difficulties may be encountered by the salesforce, which could result in poor advice being received by policyholders.

ii. Risk Premium reinsurance:

- This could be based on sum assured (i.e. the regular income protection benefit payments) or sum at risk, the former being more likely due to its simplicity for term protection policies (together with the difficulty of finding a suitable definition of sum at risk for these policies - as the risk benefit is not a lump sum).

- The portion of the sum assured (income protection annuity benefit) reinsured can be determined as: ➢ A fixed percentage of the income protection benefit, known as quota share (or reducing retention method); or ➢ All of the income protection benefit above an agreed retention, known as individual surplus (or constant retention method).

- The arrangement is likely to have low retention limits initially due to the company's lack of experience.

- This will assist in reducing claim fluctuations. ➢ This is likely to be a concern for a recently established company.

- To benefit from the reinsurer's technical assistance, which is of particular benefit here as the company is new to the market, and could include the following related to the claims risk: ➢ access to rating data and advice ➢ advice on initial and claims underwriting Individual Risk XL:

- Could be used to protect against individual claims of long duration

- Policies which would require large monthly payouts would be better dealt with using surplus reinsurance. Catastrophe (Aggregate) XL:

- Can reduce aggregations of claims caused by non-independence of risks

- While not as significant a concern as it would have been for group business, it is nevertheless of relevance. Stop Loss:

- Can protect against overall experience on the business being worse than a specified level.

- This is a potential problem as the insurer is new to the market and will thus not have much experience or data for pricing

- Such cover, however, may not be readily available Overall, this question was very poorly answered, often highlighting gaps in candidates' knowledge and/or poor exam technique including a failure to read the question carefully. In part (i) many candidates did not answer the question, simply describing what the product offered rather than describing its advantages and disadvantages relative to a conventional product as was required. Such answers scored very few marks. The unit-linked and conventional products are similar in many ways, but these were not the things candidates were expected to describe. Many candidates also wasted time speculating on general policy conditions (which were not given in the question). Many candidates failed to appreciate that conventional individual IP policies would often have risk benefits expressed in monetary terms rather than as a percentage of salary (although may have a cap expressed as a replacement ratio) and need not have guaranteed increases (be they fixed or linked to an index). Where premiums are not guaranteed, a 5-yearly review is not uncommon. They do not generally offer surrender or maturity benefits and do not cover redundancy. They commonly provide a premium waiver benefit. In part (ii) a significant number of candidates suggested reinsurance on original terms (coinsurance) for this unit-linked product, which is inappropriate. The insurer does not need cover for the death/surrender/maturity benefits, nor would a reinsurer wish to provide this unit-related benefit. Most candidates mentioned quota share and individual surplus as options, but many did not indicate that this would be under a risk premium structure as opposed to original terms and so did not gain credit, A number of candidates discussed financial reinsurance, which is not aimed at protecting against claims risk.

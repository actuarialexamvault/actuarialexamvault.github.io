## QUESTION 1

i. Risks to the policyholder:

- The main risk borne by the policyholder is that the amount of benefit provided is lower than expected, on surrender, death and on maturity. ➢ This is caused by reversionary and/or terminal bonuses being lower than expected.

- Although these with-profits contracts should provide some protection against inflation, this might not be the case in the event of poor investment returns and poor resulting bonuses.

- The policyholder is exposed to the risks that final bonuses are lower than expected due for example to: ➢ investment returns being lower than expected ➢ expenses being higher than expected ➢ other surpluses being lower than expected (e.g. higher than expected guaranteed mortality payments)

- The policyholder carries some risk of the insurer becoming insolvent.

- The policyholder is exposed to the risk of being unable to maintain premiums due to accident, sickness, redundancy, or other loss of income. ➢ The benefit received if the policy is surrendered or made paid-up may not appear to be good value for money.

- There is the risk that the policyholder does not understand the policy; and therefore it may not meet their needs. ➢ For example, if the policy was taken out to repay a mortgage on a house and the risks not explained.

- There is a risk that changes in taxation may reduce the value from the policy.

ii. Calculation of asset share

- The asset share is the accumulation of premiums less deductions associated with the contract ➢ This is accumulated at the actual rate of return earned on investments.

- An allocation of profits on any without profits business written in the with-profits fund will also be allocated to the asset share.

➢ a contribution to the free assets, to support the smoothing of bonuses and the ability to exercise greater investment flexibility.

- The asset share can be calculated recursively on a year-to-year basis.

- The asset share can be calculated for an individual policy or a group of policies.

iii. How the asset share could be used to set an amount for:

- Both maturity and death benefits may be subject to a guaranteed minimum (e.g. initial sum assured plus vested bonuses subject to a minimum). ➢ Thus asset share has no impact if the guaranteed minimum bites. ➢ This is most likely for death early in the policy term.

- The maturity value will be based on average asset share over time.

- It will depend heavily on the smoothing policy and so a particular maturity value may be above or below its asset share.

- The bonus rates are likely to be based on the asset share for an average policy, rather than each individual policy.

- If death occurs close to the maturity date, the insurer may wish for the death benefit to reflect the asset share more closely for consistency reasons Examiner's Comments Part (i) and Part (ii) were generally well answered. It was evident that some candidates did not know the theory, in which case they scored substantially worse than others. Some candidates wrote lost marks writing about accumulating with-profits and others wasted time writing about various bonus distribution methods. Part (iii) was generally not answered well and it reflected weak understanding of how an asset share is used. Candidates did not focus on the average asset share for a cohort of policies or in the case of minimum guaranteed benefits, that the asset share would have no impact on the death or maturity benefits. Many candidates thought that the maturity value must always be the same as the asset share, some suggested it must always be less otherwise the insurer makes a loss, and others thought it must always exceed the asset share.

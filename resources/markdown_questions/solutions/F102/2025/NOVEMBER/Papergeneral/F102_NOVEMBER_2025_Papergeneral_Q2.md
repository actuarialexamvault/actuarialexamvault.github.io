## QUESTION 2

i. Increased risks:
Expense risk

- The replacement of upfront charges with an increased fund-based charge delays expense recovery, especially for acquisition costs. ➢ This creates a cashflow mismatch and may result in significant new business strain.

- The pricing and profitability of the new structure depends on assumptions about withdrawals, mortality, investment returns, and premium sizes. ➢ If any of these are mis-estimated, the insurer could face losses.

- The new charging structure is more dependent on fund value, as there are more ongoing charges linked to fund value than initial charges. ➢ Lower than expected investment performance would reduce the fee income, even if expenses remain fixed, leading to the risk of insufficient charges to cover expenses. Investment risk

- More policyholders than expected may opt to invest in the more aggressive fund choices. ➢ This would result in more volatility in fund values and hence in charges than expected.

- There may be some reputational damage if an aggressive fund performs very poorly

- the insurer may be seen as partly to blame due to it making that fund choice available to policyholders. Mortality risk

- The introduction of the guaranteed minimum death benefit increases the insurer's liability on death. ➢ This is particularly so at early durations where the unit fund may be lower than the guaranteed amount.

- Since only a basic health declaration is required, this introduces increased antiselection risk, as individuals with known health issues may be more likely to buy cover.

- If this increased anti-selection risk is not adequately allowed for in the mortality assumptions, it may lead to losses for the insurer.

- Mortality claims at early durations may cause a strain since insufficient charges have been collected to recoup upfront expenses.

- Past mortality experience on which assumptions have likely been based may no longer reflect the revised product's risk profile ➢ This would be particularly so if the new features attract different segments of the market. Withdrawal risk

- Introducing partial withdrawals may encourage earlier and more frequent fund outflows, which may result in smaller charges than expected to cover expenses.

- Such withdrawals may also be anti-selective by those in poor health

- The revised structure may be based on optimistic assumptions about new business growth. If actual sales are lower, fixed costs may not be recouped.

- High sales volumes may place a significant strain on administrative processes.

- Competitors may undercut the insurer or offer more attractive terms, reducing the expected take-up and profitability of the revised product. Robo-advice tool risk

- The robo-tool may recommend inappropriate funds, leading to poor outcomes for policyholders and potential complaints ➢ or reputational damage for the insurer.

- Policyholders may misunderstand the nature of the tool and assume it provides regulated advice, leading to liability in the event of losses.

- The algorithm may have biases or flaws not detected in development, leading to misallocation of customers to funds. Outsourcing and operational risk

- Outsourced administration introduces risk of service delays, errors, or poor customer experience. ➢ This could potentially affect the insurer's reputation and persistency experience.

- Problems during the migration of the administration to a third party can lead to errors, delays and data issues.

- There is counterparty risk related to the possibility of the third-party provider failing, which could result in the insurer having to take back the administration function at a high cost.

- Transferring customer data to an external provider increases the risk of breaches or regulatory issues under data privacy laws.

- The administrator may increase their fees over time, and if the company is unable to review their charges then there is a risk of losses the company.

ii. Ways to manage risks:
Expense risk

- The insurer can consider making use of actuarial funding or the use of negative non-unit reserves, if allowed, to recover acquisition costs from future charges and reduce new business strain.

- Introduce reviewable charges to allow the insurer to adjust charges periodically if experience deviates significantly from assumptions.

- Introduce waiting periods or exclusions, for example, only cover accidental death for the first 6 months to deter anti-selective purchases.

- Obtain reinsurance cover for the guaranteed minimum death benefit, especially in the early years, to help smooth claims volatility and protect capital.

- Monitor emerging experience, particularly for the guaranteed minimum death benefit, to update valuation and pricing assumptions if adverse trends emerge.

- Narrow the fund options or use the robo-tool to steer customers towards the safer fund choices to achieve more predictable investment outcomes.

- Reduce the sum assured threshold above which more detailed underwriting is required, to reduce the risk of anti-selection.

- Introduce a risk charge on the unit fund to cover the cost of the mortality guarantee. Withdrawal risks

- Limit partial withdrawals to once every few years, say 3 years, or delay eligibility of partial withdrawals to reduce the risk of early depletion of the fund value.

- Increase the surrender penalties on full withdrawals or introduce surrender penalties on partial withdrawals to discourage early lapses. Robo-tool risks

- Validate and test the robo-tool thoroughly, including expert oversight, independent reviews and scenario testing to ensure recommendations are suitable.

- Provide clear disclaimers clarifying that the tool is guidance, not regulated advice, to limit legal liability. Third-party risks

- Define clear performance metrics and penalties for the outsourced admin provider to ensure accountability.

Candidates who tried to combine parts i and ii of the question into a single solution did not score well.
Candidates needed to consider the additional risks arising from each of the proposed changes, as well as practical methods of managing these risks.

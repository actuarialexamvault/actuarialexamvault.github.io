## QUESTION 3

i. Main needs met:

- The benefit on maturity allows the policyholder to save for a specific purpose ➢ The range of investment portfolios meet the need for diversification

- The death benefit meets the need of providing for the policyholder's dependents or liabilities due on death (e.g. paying back a loan). ➢ As the policyholder can specify the sum assured, the product can be tailored to be more of a risk product (a relatively large sum assured, for a given premium) or a savings product (a relatively small sum assured, for a given premium). ➢ The death benefit is also a way of passing wealth to the next generation in a tax-efficient way

- The surrender benefit could provide funds in the case of a financial emergency.

- The charging structure is relatively simple and therefore easy to understand.

- The policyholder can specify the premium and therefore meet the need of affordability. ➢ Premiums are also payable monthly, which again makes the product more affordable than a single premium product, for example.

- As the product is unit-linked, the policyholder carries some risk (e.g. investment risk) which means this product is possibly more cost effective relative to a nonlinked version of the contract.

ii. Reasons for a minimum premium:

- Each policy must contribute adequately to the company's expenses and profit. ➢ The minimum premium ensures that the fund management charge will be sufficient, on average over the duration of the policy, to adequately meet these expenses and profit contribution. ➢ There may be some cross-subsidies in this regard, with larger policies contributing relatively more than smaller policies.

- The premium needs to be sufficient to meet the cost of cover. ➢ As the policyholder can select the sum assured, the minimum premium will need to be at least sufficient to meet the cost of cover.

- Attracting a specific target market. ➢ Higher premiums should lead to a higher income/wealth client profile which may be the preferred target market for the insurer.

iii. Method:

- The expropriation price is the price at which a unit would be cancelled and is determined as: ➢ The net asset value of the fund on a "bid basis"; ➢ Divided by the number of units existing at the time of calculation (before any units are cancelled).

- The net asset value of the fund on a "bid basis" is calculated as: ➢ The market value of the assets held by the fund on a bid basis. ➢ Less the expenses that would be incurred in the sale. ➢ Plus the value of any current assets (e.g. cash on deposit). ➢ Less the value of any current liabilities (e.g. investments purchased but not yet settled). ➢ Plus any accrued income (e.g. interest income on deposits) net of any outgo (e.g. fund charges). ➢ Less any allowance for accrued tax, if applicable.

iv. Examples include:

- The unit price includes accruals and the actual cashflows may be different to the accrual. ➢ For example, when an asset is sold, the actual capital gains tax (CGT) may be different to the accrual for CGT due to a change in the CGT rules. If the tax accrual was understated (overstated), then policyholders who previously sold (bought) units, would have benefitted from the actual tax being different to the accrual relative to the current (previous) generation of policyholders.

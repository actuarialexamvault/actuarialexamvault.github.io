## QUESTION 4

i. Policy data checks:

- Data reconciliation checks whereby the current data is checked against the previous data as follows: ➢ Data at previous investigation + business come onto the books - business gone off the books = data at current investigation. ➢ This can be done for appropriate groups of contracts, such as by year of entry. ➢ For example, this check can be done for:

- the number of contracts,

- basic sum assured,

- premiums, or

- amount of attaching bonuses.

- Consistency checks whereby metrics per appropriate group are sensible and consistent with previous, for example: ➢ Averages of asset shares, sums assured, reversionary bonuses and premiums ➢ Ratios of asset shares and sums assured to premiums ➢ Ratios of reversionary bonuses to sums assured.

- Consistency of data between different sources, for example: ➢ The movements data (business coming on and going off during the period) can be checked against appropriate accounting data (specifically premiums and benefit payments). ➢ Investment data from fund managers (e.g. investment income and assets) can be checked against accounting data. ➢ Cashflows (premiums less claims and expenses) received by fund managers can be checked against accounting data.

- Unusual values and spot checks, for example: ➢ Bonuses accrued should not exceed plausible levels based on historical declared rates ➢ Terms only 10 years ➢ No zeroes or missing values ➢ Ages at entry and start dates within expected ranges ➢ A paid-up policy should have a reduced sum assured and zero premium ➢ Only in-force policies

ii. Reserves valued using a cashflow projection:

- Project the expected cashflows in each future year, including: ➢ Premiums ➢ Claims ➢ Expenses including ongoing commission (if any)

- Future new business is excluded.

- This is done per policy, or using appropriate grouped model points.

- The starting benefit amount is the basic sum assured plus all vesting reversionary bonuses to date.

- Allowance is made for expected future reversionary bonuses consistent with the expected investment returns on the assets backing the portfolio, ➢ as well as other considerations, such as company bonus philosophy and policyholder reasonable expectations.

- Allow for all guarantees if any, such as minimum surrender or maturity values.

- The expected future net outgo (claims + expenses - premiums) at each future time period is discounted to the present.

iii. Impact on solvency:

- The market value of equities will fall whereas the market value of bonds will rise.

- The overall impact will depend on the mix of assets held, which will depend on the maturity of the book and the split between terminal and reversionary bonuses.

- The reserves will increase due to the lower interest rates, all else being equal.

- The net effect may be a deterioration of the insurer's solvency position.

iv. Possible mitigating actions include:

- The insurer could apply temporary market value adjustments to surrender values.

- Terminal bonuses could be reduced, or removed entirely, if the impact of the crash is particularly severe.

- Depending on the outlook for recovery, future bonus rate assumptions could be reduced or deferred, reducing reserves.

- Policyholders' reasonable expectations must be considered when changing bonus structures.

- It might be possible, although likely costly, to adjust the investment portfolio temporarily to limit further potential losses (including the use of derivatives).

- If particularly severe, management may consider reducing non-essential expenses.

- If warranted, basis changes may be considered to weaken the basis and reduce reserves.

- If solvency is at risk, capital raising exercises may be considered, including use of financial reinsurance.

- The insurer could close to new business temporarily, thereby removing new business strain and avoiding a further deterioration in solvency in the short term. However, this will reduce profitability in the longer term.

(i) and (ii) were primarily bookwork, while weaker candidates tended to provide too few points
or presented their answers in a poorly structured manner.
For part (ii), many students focused excessively on describing valuation bases and margins rather than identifying the key cashflows. A common omission was the failure to account for bonuses within the model. Several students also incorrectly treated reserves as PV of inflows minus PV of outflows, rather than the correct formulation of PV of outgo minus PV of inflow.
Part (iii) was generally poorly answered, with many responses being overly prescriptive.
Statements suggesting that a particular outcome "will" occur were not credited--candidates were expected to discuss likelihoods rather than certainties. Many students also overlooked bonds in their explanations, and some made the fundamental error of failing to note that a decrease in interest rates increases present values.
Part (iv) was also weakly answered. Many candidates did not produce enough distinct points or repeated the same ideas. Additionally, several suggestions were made without consideration of their implications--for example, changes to investment strategy may carry significant cost.

## QUESTION 5

i. Product features of an accumulating with-profits and a unit-linked product:

- Both an accumulating with-profits and unit-linked product have an explicit link between the premiums/contributions to date and the benefit payable to the policyholder.

- In the case of a unit-linked policy, the policyholders' contributions are invested into the chosen underlying fund and the policyholders fund value moves in line with the performance of the underlying fund. ➢ Fixed and fund-related charges may be deducted from the policyholder's fund and returns for calculating unit price may be net of asset management costs.

- For accumulating with-profits, the policyholder's premiums/contributions are accumulated over-time and bonuses are added to the fund value based on the bonuses declared by the insurer. ➢ Fixed and fund-related charges may be deducted from the policyholder's fund, and bonuses declared may be net of some costs (e.g. asset management).

- Bonuses declared may depend on the insurer's discretion or can be based on a pre-determined formula.

- While accumulating with-profit bonuses are generally smoothed over time to provide stable growth, reflecting past investment performance of the with-profit fund, they may also be influenced by historical bonuses declared and future expected investment return.

- Special once-off bonuses can be applicable on the accumulating with-profits policies, particularly where there are materially higher returns which are not expected to repeat.

- For both products, surrender values are often stipulated as a function of the fund balance less surrender penalties.

- However, in the accumulating with-profits instance, market value adjustors might be applied in some circumstances in order to prevent anti selection.

ii. Setting assumptions:

- The company may start from prior experience investigations used for pricing or reserving.

- The company should consider the requirements of the regulator and any professional guidance.

- The assumptions should not be arbitrarily different from the previous valuation assumptions, and assumption changes should be suitably supported and documented and their impact disclosed.

- Unit fund growth: ➢ Determine an expected growth rate by asset class as a risk-free rate, probably based on government bonds of suitable term, plus a suitable risk premium that varies by asset class.

- The risk premiums could be based on past investment returns or a CAPM model for risky assets. ➢ The overall risk premium and expected growth rate is based on an expected split of unit funds by asset class based on the investment mandate of the fund. ➢ Prudence would require a lower unit growth rate.

- Demographic assumptions: ➢ Use recent own demographic experience based on investigations and adjusted for known or expected future changes. ➢ For surrenders (full or partial), a prudent assumption will likely be higher than best estimate given that it will reduce the future fund charges in excess of expenses and cost of benefits (assuming this excess is positive). ➢ The mortality assumption is not such a key assumption given that the additional death benefit is small and the mortality rates are likely to be low. May use standard mortality tables adjusted for experience. ➢ A higher than best estimate assumption will be prudent.

- Expenses: ➢ Use recent expense investigation i.e. the expenses allocated to this product. ➢ Need to allow for expected in force volumes to capture the spread of overhead. ➢ A higher than best estimate expense assumption is prudent.

➢ Prudent to assume higher expense inflation and lower consumer prices inflation (for the charges).

- Discount rate/valuation interest rate: ➢ Likely to consider yields on the assets backing the non-unit reserve. Likely to use a risk-free rate based on government bonds or cash. ➢ A lower rate is more prudent in the event of positive reserves. Examiner's Comments Candidates performed quite well on the question. Part (i) was largely bookwork and candidates were able to compare the two products appropriately. Part (ii) was generally well answered and candidates who did better were able to discuss a variety of assumptions and describe the margins required in order for it to be a prudent valuation.

## QUESTION 6

i. Reasons for the new product:

- Competitive reasons: other insurers offer this product, or if they don't this may provide a competitive advantage - the insurer hopes to increase its overall sales.

- Enhance its brand - especially if no/few other insurers offer this product, customers may view the insurer as being innovative and a leader in the industry.

- Meeting customer needs better - increasing uncertainty about future inflation is increasing customer needs for products that provide some protection against higher inflation.

- Regulatory changes might now be creating a market (or bigger market) for this product - e.g. inclusion as a default product for pension schemes.

- Insufficient suitable assets in the market (i.e. fixed-interest bonds of adequate term) for matching without-profits liabilities - while the new product also has fixed guarantees they should be lower.

- Capital efficiency - fewer guarantees should require lower capital requirements, thus freeing up capital for other purposes. ➢ The product may lead to higher return on capital for shareholders - i.e. higher profitability.

ii. Suitable investments:

- The guaranteed benefits (comprising initial income plus declared increases) are fixed in monetary terms and hence: ➢ This may be best matched by government fixed interest bonds of suitable term. ➢ The insurer may invest in high-quality corporate bonds to enhance its returns, however, these carry default loss risk.

- Discretionary benefits (comprising future increases) are real in nature (and not index-linked) and hence best matched by: ➢ Index linked bonds will provide the minimum real return being targeted if they are held to maturity. ➢ Equity and property can be expected to provide positive real returns over longer time periods, although they will be associated with volatility over shorter periods.

- Expenses are mostly staff and IT-related and real in nature. ➢ This will be best matched by a combination of equity, property and index linked bonds.

- Cash would be held as working capital to meet short-term obligations.

- The insurer is likely to prefer direct investment, however this may be impractical for some types of assets such as property and offshore investment, in which case an indirect form of investment may be used.

iii. Key risks:

- Mortality risk - risk of mortality being lighter than expected: ➢ As this is a new product, the annuitant profile may differ from existing products. ➢ The scope for mortality improvements in a developing country may be difficult to quantify.

- Investment risk - risk of returns being lower than required: ➢ The insurer may not be able to match the CPI-linked increase for life. ➢ As this is a developing country, there may not be sufficient stock of indexlinked bonds of varying terms available in the local market. ➢ Default on ILBs will leave the insurer with insufficient assets to meet liabilities. ➢ Investment risk is exacerbated if mortality is lighter than expected as this may require re-investment at unknown future terms.

iv. Market option pricing techniques:

- Market prices of options replicating the guarantee are required.

➢ Call option of suitable term (reflecting endowment term) on an index-linked bond (of duration reflecting expected lifespan at GAO exercise date) with strike being equal to the ILB price corresponding to the guaranteed real interest rate.

- If market prices are not available estimates may be available from market participants.

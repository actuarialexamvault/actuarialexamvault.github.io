## QUESTION 7

i. Factors to consider include:

- Average benefit level for the product and the expected distribution of the benefit.

- Company's insurance risk appetite.

- Level of the company's free assets and the importance attached to the stability of its free asset ratio.

- Terms on which reinsurance can be obtained and the dependence of such terms on the retention limit.

- Level of familiarity of the company with underwriting the type of business involved.

- Company's expertise in pricing such a product vis-à-vis the reinsurer's expertise.

- Any regulatory requirements with regards to minimum / maximum level of session.

- Effect on the company's regulatory capital requirements of increasing or reducing the retention limit.

- Existence of a profit-sharing arrangement in the reinsurance treaty.

- Company's retention on its other products.

- Nature of any future increases in sum assured.

ii. Reasons:

- Group schemes are typically repriced annually based on the most recent claims experience. This short feedback loop allows the reinsurer to adjust premiums quickly in response to emerging trends, reducing the long-term risk of pricing inadequacy. In contrast, individual IP policies often involve long-term guarantees, increasing pricing risk.

- Gondor Life can request quotes from multiple reinsurers each year. This competitive dynamic incentivises Rivendell Re to offer more attractive terms to retain the business, especially if the experience is favourable.

- The application of an FCL reduces the number of medically underwritten lives referred to the reinsurer. This lowers administrative costs and simplifies risk acceptance processes, which can be reflected in more competitive pricing.

- The group scheme likely comprises a sufficiently large number of members with similar risk characteristics--such as occupation (mining industry) and geographic location. This homogeneity allows for more accurate pricing through risk pooling.

- Compulsory membership ensures that both good risks and bad risks are gained, which reduces or eliminates anti-selection risk. This allows for better cross subsidising of risk and therefore will impact the actual claims costs.

- Benefits are determined by a fixed formula linked to salary, which prevents antiselection through over- or under-insurance. This design ensures that benefit levels are proportionate to earnings, aligning incentives and reducing moral hazard.

- With three years of claims experience available, Rivendell Re can perform a more informed actuarial analysis. This enhances pricing accuracy and may justify more favourable terms if the experience has been stable or better than expected.

iii. Reasons:

- Group schemes often lack detailed member-level data. In this case, Gondor Life is unlikely to provide: ➢ Full policy histories or transitions between health states. ➢ Information on lives entering or exiting claim during the deferred period. ➢ Recovery data or transitions back to premium-paying status. ➢ The available data is likely limited to basic demographic data (e.g., sex, date of birth, salary, NRA) and current claim information.

- Given the data constraints, a multi-state model would be impractical due to insufficient granularity of data.

- It focuses on estimating the expected cost of claims incepting in a given year, which aligns with the annual repricing cycle typical of group schemes.

- It simplifies the modelling process by separating the estimation of claim incidence rates from the expected duration and cost of claims via a disabled life annuity factor.

- For group schemes, members may enter and exit the scheme regularly as they change employers meaning that there may be even less information available about different states a member may be in over time.

- It is efficient to implement, especially when data is sparse or aggregated.

- It is flexible, allowing for adjustments based on emerging experience or changes in benefit design.

may be more favourable than for individual IP policies. Instead, weaker answers drifted into generic comments about competitiveness or reinsurer behaviour, without contrasting group versus individual business.
Part (iii) was the weakest-scoring part of the question. A large proportion of candidates failed to identify the key rationale: namely, that the alternative to the chosen pricing approach would typically be a multi-state model, and that such a model is inappropriate or impractical given the limited, aggregate nature of group scheme data. Many answers simply described features of inception/disability annuity pricing without explaining why this method was chosen over the multi-state alternative.

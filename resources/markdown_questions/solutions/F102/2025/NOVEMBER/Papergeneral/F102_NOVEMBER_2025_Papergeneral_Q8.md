## QUESTION 8

i. Experience to monitor:
New business

- Monitor number of policies as well as the premiums and/or benefits.

- Since this is a recently established company, it will be important to achieve the sales targets. Lapses

- Monitor the lapses in terms of premiums and/or benefits.

- Higher than expected lapses will affect the insurer's revenues and profits.

- This may also indicate that there are other problems that need investigation e.g. the sales process or uncompetitive premiums. Engagement

- Monitor the data (if any) provided by each policyholder for benefit increase triggers. ➢ Or social media profile sharing from which such information might be gathered. ➢ Or how often the policyholder interacts with the app.

- This is needed to measure the success of the mobile phone app as a general means for interacting.

- The success of the take-up offer in particular depends on policyholders disclosing the necessary information. Take-up rates on offers made

- The percentage of offers taken up. ➢ Split by type and also the percentage of the total additional benefit take up.

Mortality experience

- Compare actual vs expected for the entire portfolio and for benefit increases separately.

- As this is still likely to be a small portfolio, it may be difficult to understand the effect of random variation.

- Benefit increases should ideally be split by type and also the percentage of the total additional benefit take up. ➢ May be difficult to split into smaller categories until more policies are available to ensure credibility of each category.

- May provide early indications of anti-selection.

- May provide early indication of changes required to offer assumptions and pricing. Expenses

- Monitor against pricing assumptions and expense loadings.

- As well as against business plans.

- This is important for maintaining control over expenses based on the size of the book. ➢ Especially if the book is not growing according to the business plan.

ii. Conducting an expense analysis:

- Collect and summarise expenses for the last three years: salaries and related costs, property costs, computer costs, investment costs, marketing costs and commission.

- Start by classifying the company's non-commission expenses by department/function into: ➢ new business (or initial) expenses; ➢ existing business (or renewal) expenses; ➢ termination expenses; and ➢ investment expenses.

- Each of the first three can be further split according to whether the expense is proportional to: ➢ the number of policies written or in-force; ➢ the premiums written or in force; or ➢ the sum assured written or in force.

- This creates a series of 'cells' for dividing expenses into.

- Since there are only term assurance policies expenses do not have to be split between products.

- Administration costs, overheads and systems running costs could be split by costs associated with new business and costs associated with in-force business. ➢ Possibly proportional to the sum assured (or premium) for new business and the in-force business.

➢ It is unlikely to be a significant expense in this case as term assurance policies do not build-up large reserves and it is still early in the policy / company lifetime.

- Commission is generally known and can be excluded from the expense analysis and loaded explicitly.

- System development costs can be amortised over the expected lifetime of the system.

- The per policy costs can then be determined as: ➢ Initial expenses allocated divided by the amount of new business; ➢ Renewal expenses allocated divided by the amount of existing business; and ➢ Termination expenses divided by the number of terminations. Examiner's Comments In part (i) there were many points that could be made on monitoring that all insurance companies would want to do. Candidates received limited credit for generic points. The better solutions addressed the specific issues in the question i.e. a new company with limited experience, potentially random (good or bad) claims experience and a need to understand if their business/product is going to be successful. Part (ii) is a standard question, asked often, with small changes in application. While there were some excellent solutions, the solutions were generally disappointing. There was also some evidence of time pressure for this last question, indicating poor exam planning and/or discipline.
